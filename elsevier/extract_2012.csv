Highlights ► We show people are unable to appropriately judge outcomes of moral behaviour. ► Moral beliefs have weaker impact when there is a presence of significant self-gain. ► People make highly self-serving choices in real moral situations. ► Real moral choices contradict responses to simple hypothetical moral probes. ► Enhancing context can cause hypothetical decisions to mirror real moral decisions. Abstract Moral ideals are strongly ingrained within society and individuals alike, but actual moral choices are profoundly influenced by tangible rewards and consequences. Across two studies we show that real moral decisions can dramatically contradict moral choices made in hypothetical scenarios (Study 1). However, by systematically enhancing the contextual information available to subjects when addressing a hypothetical moral problem—thereby reducing the opportunity for mental simulation—we were able to incrementally bring subjects’ responses in line with their moral behaviour in real situations (Study 2). These results imply that previous work relying mainly on decontextualized hypothetical scenarios may not accurately reflect moral decisions in everyday life. The findings also shed light on contextual factors that can alter how moral decisions are made, such as the salience of a personal gain. Keywords Morality Real moral decision-making Contextual information Motivational factors 1 Introduction Bertrand Russell captured the nature of human morality when he stated “we have two kinds of morality side by side: one which we preach but do not practice and another which we practice but seldom preach” (Russell, 2004). Despite this capacity for moral hypocrisy, adhering to a human moral code—a set of complex, evolved, and learned capacities (Wright, 1994)—is integral to promoting pro-social interactions. These interactions are guided by deeply ingrained moral proscriptions, perhaps the most important of which is not to harm others (Cushman, Young, & Hauser, 2006; Haidt, 2007). Aversion to harming others is a moral imperative that not only transcends cultures (Brown, 1991), but also species (Masserman, Wechkin, & Terris, 1964). It is so strongly held that it can drive our hypothetical moral choices, even when a readiness to inflict harm would serve the greater good (Foot, 1978). In fact, aversion to harm appears to intensify as the prospect of hurting another becomes increasingly ‘up close and personal’ (Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001), with people more likely to avoid inflicting harm if they have to carry out the physical act themselves. This is illustrated most starkly by people’s responses to moral scenarios like the classic Trolley dilemmas. In these hypothetical moral problems, participants are willing to acquiesce to killing another person in order to save the lives of five others if it requires flipping a switch to change the direction of the out-of-control trolley (Trolley Dilemma). However, in the Footbridge Dilemma, there is an almost universal refusal to contemplate killing another by physically pushing them in front of the trolley even if the act would save five others (Foot, 1978; Greene et al., 2001). But do people practice what they preach when it comes to averting harm in real life? While this moral proscription to not harm others has been repeatedly shown to underpin hypothetical moral decisions (Cushman et al., 2006; Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, & Cohen, 2004; Waldmann & Dieterich, 2007), it is unclear how much it motivates real moral choices, especially when those choices directly involve the option for self-benefit. In fact, daily life and human history are rife with examples of people being harmed in exchange for personal gain or higher ideals. So what can explain this apparent disconnect between the data from decades of research on human morality (Greene & Haidt, 2002; Haidt, 2001; Kohlberg, 1973; Moll, Zahn, de Oliveira-Souza, Krueger, & Grafman, 2005) and anecdotal evidence amassed over hundreds of years of historical record? A key factor is that research on human morality has largely focused on hypothetical moral reasoning. Most commonly, subjects are presented with hypothetical moral vignettes (Cikara, Farnsworth, Harris, & Fiske, 2010; Crockett, Clark, Hauser, & Robbins, 2010; Greene et al., 2001; Greene et al., 2004; Kahane et al., 2011; Tassy et al., 2011), stripped of all non-essential contextual information, and then queried on their intention to perform an action. These stylised scenarios act as a barometer for subject’s moral knowledge and the responses can be taken as a rough indication of subjects’ readiness to perform the associated moral behaviour (Ajzen, Brown, & Carvajal, 2004). The reliance on these kinds of hypothetical moral probes potentially presents limitations to understanding moral cognition. First, philosophical dilemmas such as the Trolley and Footbridge scenarios capture a particular kind of moral tension, where the choice to harm another is offset against the ‘greater good’ (i.e. saving five lives at the cost of one). It is arguably rare in the real world to be faced with the kinds of utilitarian decisions encapsulated in these classic dilemmas (Knutson et al., 2010), where the welfare of many is pitted against one’s reluctance to commit a personal act of violence. We contend that most moral choices that face us in daily life pit the fundamental motivation of not harming others (physically or psychologically) against that of maximising self-gain (Haidt, 2007), and that this distinct class of moral tension is especially prevalent in everyday life. Accordingly, the motivational force of self-benefit is poorly understood, as research to date has largely steered clear of using probes encapsulating this prototypical moral conflict. Second, using hypothetical probes assumes that there is a strong link between the moral intentions that they elicit and action in the real world (Teper, Inzlicht, & Page-Gould, 2011). But the stories of lying, cheating, and stealing that fill newspapers and history books suggest little congruence with the psychological data demonstrating people’s reported aversion to harming others. So why might the link between people’s stated moral intentions and their action be weaker than often presumed? Moral cognition, like any dynamic system, relies on complex cognitive processes that integrate socio-emotional factors, such as situational cues, past experience, and potential future rewards or consequences (Bandura, 1989). Indeed, research on the psychology of choice has illustrated that decisions are influenced by reward and punishment contingencies (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981), as well as the environment in which they are made (Isen & Levin, 1972). To ascertain if hypothetical moral probes act as a good proxy for real moral behaviour, moral cognition needs to be studied in action-relevant environments where the stakes are immediate (Kang, Rangel, Camus, & Camerer, 2011), emotionally charged (Teper et al., 2011), and tangible. The central aims of the studies reported here were to shift the focus of psychological inquiry by investigating moral decision-making in situations where harm to another and significant personal gain act in direct opposition. And then to examine how this moral tension was resolved in both hypothetical and real contexts. 2 Study 1 Since the literature reports that aversion to harm is such an influential force in hypothetical moral decisions (Cushman et al., 2006), our first assumption was that this deeply seated moral imperative would dictate peoples’ predictions of human moral choices. To test this, in Study 1a we asked people whether they thought future participants would be more or less likely to avoid harming another for significant personal gain if the stakes were real compared to hypothetical. Our prediction was that subjects would postulate that in real moral scenarios people would be more likely to abide by the harm principle than those imagining doing the same scenario. Study 1b then examined whether the views of the survey sample were borne out: we directly compared real and hypothetical decisions in two experimental conditions. Our prediction was that when motivational forces are concrete and real rather than presented in a hypothetical scenario, the incentive for significant self-benefit would become more compelling than the proscription not to harm others. In short, while people in our survey (Study 1a) might predict that the aversion to harming others would be more influential in real moral situations compared to hypothetical ones, an experimental test (Study 1b) would reveal the opposite (Batson, Kobrynowicz, Dinnerstein, Kampf, & Wilson, 1997; Tetlock, 2003). 1 An important aspect of these predictions is that we are referring to situations where harm aversion is pitted against significant personal gain. For the majority of people, making any choice to harm another has a personal cost, as it comes with an awareness that a moral code has been violated (not to mention the potential social distress associated with being caught making such a choice). We contend that for personal gain to drive such a choice, it has to be substantial enough to offset potential moral pain and social opprobrium (cf. Teper et al., 2011). 1 To test our hypotheses, we used both real and hypothetical versions of a ‘Pain versus Gain’ paradigm (PvG; Fig. 1 a) where we asked participants (Deciders) to make a moral choice: benefit oneself financially or prevent physical harm to another (the Receiver). Deciders chose how much, if any, of a £20 endowment they would spend to prevent a series of painful electric shocks from reaching the Receiver. The more money Deciders paid on a given trial (up to £1 per trial—20 trials), the lower the shock level inflicted. Paying £1 removed the shock altogether; paying nothing ensured the highest shock level. The outcome variable was how much money Deciders kept across 20 trials (Money Kept), with lower amounts indicating that preventing harm was prioritized. Deciders watched the shocks being inflicted via video feed (Fig. 1b). Importantly, Deciders were also informed that all money remaining after 20 trials would be randomly multiplied to a potential maximum pay-out of £200. This was designed to make the potential personal gains on offer significant and motivationally compelling. 2.1 Study 1a: A survey predicting moral behaviour 2.1.1 Methods 2.1.1.1 Participants We recruited 88 participants (mean age 30.8, and SD±0.6; 35 females) for the survey. For this study and for the others reported here, participants were recruited from the volunteer panel at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge UK, and from the postgraduate student community in Cambridge. Participants in the studies were compensated for their time and travel and allowed to keep any earnings accumulated during the task. Participants gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the University of Cambridge, Dept. of Psychology Research Ethics Committee. 2.1.1.2 Materials and procedure Participants were asked to complete a survey questionnaire regarding their predictions of what other participants would do during both Real and Hypothetical versions of the PvG task described above. The PvG task was outlined and the survey participants were explicitly asked whether other (future) subjects participating in our studies would inflict more or less harm on the PvG task when carrying it out for real as compared to simply imagining carrying it out. 2.1.2 Results and discussion As expected (Gilbert & Wilson, 2007; Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, & Axsom, 2000), the significant majority of subjects surveyed (74%) thought that the proscription to not harm others would exert a greater influence during the real condition, resulting in people keeping less money in the Real PvG compared to the Hypothetical PvG. 2.2 Study 1b: An experimental test of moral behaviour The next question was whether these predictions of human moral behaviour (identified in our survey; Study 1a) were borne out in real moral action. To look at this, in Study 1b we asked one group of subjects to make a hypothetical judgment about how much money they would imagine keeping in the PvG task. We then compared their judgments to the responses of those completing a Real version of the PvG task. Our prediction was that, counter to the consensus view held by our survey sample, those participants completing the Real PvG would prioritize personal gain over another’s physical welfare to a greater extent than participants engaging with the Hypothetical PvG. 2.2.1 Methods 2.2.1.1 Participants Forty-six participants completed Study 1b; 20 (mean age 26.6, and SD±4.3; 9 females) completed the Real PvG task and 26 (mean age 25.5, and SD±2.0; 18 females) completed the Hypothetical PvG scenario. Four additional participants were excluded from analyses due to expressing significant doubts about the veracity of the Real PvG task on a questionnaire administered at the end of the experimental session (see below). 2.2.1.2 Materials 2.2.1.2.1 The Real PvG task setup In order to avoid priming moral attitudes and to minimise explicit moral reasoning during task performance, we recruited subjects under the pretence of participating in a psychology study investigating economic decisions. We also went to great lengths to ensure that our participants believed the paradigm, including the use of detailed experimenter scripts and meticulous and comprehensive experimental set up. Prior to the task, each subject and our confederate (who took the role of Receiver) completed paperwork where subjects provided consent both to receive and administer electric shocks. Both participants (true subject and confederate) were told that they were recruited from two different panels—one subject preselected to be the Decider (the true subject administering the shocks) and the other to be the Receiver (the confederate receiving the shocks). In order to introduce a personal element to the task context and to enhance the believability of the protocol, the Decider and Receiver were together and allowed to interact. They were then both taken to the testing laboratory that housed the electric shock generator, a Digitimer DS7A, and briefed on the set up of the experiment. The Decider, sitting in the place where the Receiver would subsequently sit for the duration of the experiment, received the low-level shock choice and was asked to rate his/her own pain on a 10-point scale (anchored from 1=no pain to 10=extreme pain). This was to provide the Decider with explicit information concerning what the Receiver would later experience during the Real PvG task. The Decider was then taken to another room while the Receiver was purportedly connected to the shock generator (see Fig. 1a). Once there, the Decider was endowed with a real £20 note and told that the money could be used to stop or attenuate the shocks planned for the Receiver. Effectively, the more money the subject paid, the lower the shock level the other participant received on a given trial. Consequently to stop all of the shocks across all 20 trials, Deciders would need to spend all £20. During the PvG task subjects believed they were viewing in real time actual shocks being administered to the Receiver, who was sitting in a nearby testing laboratory, via a video feed. However, the videos were in fact pre-recorded films of actual shocks being administered to the confederate, pre-rated by an independent group so as to be matched for shock level and corresponding pain intensity. 2.2.1.2.2 Stimuli The Real PvG task comprised a series of 8 screens per trial across 20 trials (see Fig. 1b). Each trial began with a screen displaying the running amount of the subject’s bank total (£20 on Trial 1) and current trial number. Subjects then had to decide upon, and use a visual analogue scale (VAS) to select the amount of money they wanted to spend on that trial and thus the corresponding shock to be administered to the Receiver. This phase was partitioned into the “decide” and “select” periods. The Decide screen was presented for a fixed 3s during which subjects were asked to think about their decision. The select screen was self-paced. After making a selection, subjects saw a 3s display of their choice before experiencing a 4s anticipation phase during which subjects were told their choice was being transmitted over the internal network to the adjacent testing lab where the Receiver was connected to the shock generator. Following this anticipation period, subjects viewed a 4s video of the shock being administered to the Receiver, or no shock if they had opted to spend the full £1 permitted on a given trial. During this video feed, subjects viewed the Receiver’s hand reacting to the choice shock. Finally, subjects used a seven point VAS to rate their distress levels on viewing the consequences of their decision, before viewing a 4s inter-trial-interval (ITI). At the conclusion of the 20 trials, subjects were able to press a button to randomly multiply any remaining money between 1 and 10times. 2.2.1.2.3 Shock administration A Digitimer DS7A, which is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved device for both experimental and clinical settings, was used to administer the shocks in the Real PvG. Subjects received a mild, non-harmful sample electric shock via an electrode dipped in saline solution placed on the underside of their right wrist. While subjective pain level is different for everyone, a barely perceptible, non-painful shock would approximately be 50μs with 2.5mA at 400V; subjects received a ‘low’ level sample shock at 2.5mA with 200ms at 400V prior to their role as Decider. 2.2.1.2.4 Post-experiment questionnaire After the experimental session was finished for the Real PvG condition, subjects answered a series of questions that asked them to indicate on 8 point Likert scales: (1) whether they felt they were being watched during the experiment (anchored 1=always watched, 8=never watched). This was in order to examine any putative effects of reputation management on responses; (2) how much responsibility they (as Deciders) had for the electric stimulations administered (anchored 1=no responsibility, 8=full responsibility). This was to verify that participants did feel responsible for their choices, and also to explore whether degree of reported responsibility was associated with the behavioural outcomes; (3) and whether subjects had any doubt as to the veracity of the paradigm (anchored 1=completely believed, 8=did not believe). This was to allow us to exclude participants who indicated disbelief in the protocol (those scoring above the mid-way point on the scale; see below). We also checked if subjects were aware of Milgram’s famous Obedience study (Milgram, 1963) as we wanted to able to explore whether such knowledge had an influence on participants behaviour. 2.2.1.2.5 Hypothetical Scenario PvG task Subjects in this condition completed a contextually impoverished written version of the PvG probe (Scenario PvG). The aim was to use the same format favoured by the majority of the literature on moral reasoning (Greene et al., 2001). Subjects were asked to imagine a scenario in which they and another volunteer have both agreed to participate in a psychology experiment. They are told that in this scenario they have been given £20 at the beginning of the experiment and informed that any money they have left at the end can be multiplied up to 10times with a possible pay out of £200. This is money they can keep. Participants are then told that their task is to make decisions regarding the number and intensity of painful but harmless electric shocks the other volunteer will receive. They are informed that they can spend their £20 to reduce the pain of the shocks or to stop the shocks from reaching the other volunteer altogether. Having imagined this situation, participants are asked whether they will spend their £20 to ensure no shocks reach the other volunteer, or whether they will keep the money at the expense of the other participants’ physical welfare. 2.2.2 Results and discussion Participants in the Real PvG and Scenario PvG groups were matched for age (t(44)=0.46, p =0.65), however, the groups were not matched for gender ratio: consequently our key analysis was repeated with gender as a covariate. In Study 1a, our survey sample strongly endorsed the view that future participants in the PvG task would be more likely to preserve the welfare of the Receiver (and thus keep less money for themselves) in the real condition than in the hypothetical condition. However, the results of Study 1b (Fig. 2 a) were in stark contrast to this. The data showed that Deciders kept most of their endowment in the Real PvG condition (mean: £12.52/£20; SD±4.8) and more than seven times as much as the participants completing the hypothetical Scenario PvG task (mean: £1.53/£20; SD±5.43; [t(44)=7.12, p <0.0001, Cohen’s d =2.05]), where nearly all of the endowment was relinquished to protect the Receiver from harm. This difference remained significant when gender was included as a covariate (F(1,43)=37.3, p <0.0001). In fact, only 7% of the subjects in the Scenario PvG condition said they would keep any portion of the money at the Receiver’s expense. In contrast, in the Real PvG condition 100% of subjects kept a portion of their original £20. There was no support for Money Kept being significantly associated with degree of belief in the veracity of the paradigm (r(18)=0.28, p =0.24; mean believability score on a 8-point likert scale: 1.85, SD=±0.93). However, since the believability of the PvG paradigm is paramount in interpreting the results, we also analysed the data from subjects (n =15) who rated the PvG paradigm as only a 1 or 2 on the 8-point believability scale. These subjects kept a comparable amount of money as the full sample of 20 (mean=£11.75, SD=±4.8), and significantly more than the hypothetical scenario group (t(39)=6.01, p <0.0001, Cohen’s d =2.04). There was still no significant correlation between beliefs and Money Kept for this group (r(13)=.23, p =0.41). Importantly, there was no evidence that subjects modified their moral decisions on the Real PvG task in response to reputation management—as indexed by feelings of being watched (Landsberger, 1958)—since the relevant post study rating did not correlate significantly with Money Kept (r(13)=−0.32; p =0.45: responses only acquired for 15 of the 20 subjects). Additionally, for the Real PvG, participants rated themselves more responsible than either the Experimenter or the Receiver for the pain inflicted on the Receiver. There were no significant differences in correlations between Money Kept and degree of responsibility (r(18)=0.20, p =0.41; mean responsibility ratings on a 8-point likert scale: 6.35, SD±1.53). Furthermore, awareness of Milgram’s Obedience study did not correlate significantly with Money Kept (r(18)=−0.33, p =0.15). In fact, only six subjects reported being aware of Milgram’s study and greater awareness was in the direction of being associated with keeping less money. One might suppose that knowledge of the Milgram experiment might reduce participants’ belief in the current study, however, the data illustrates the opposite association. Finally, Deciders’ subjective pain ratings of the sample shock revealed that they found the lowest shock uncomfortable, and these ratings did not correlate significantly with Money Kept (r(18)=−0.22, p =0.35; mean pain ratings on a 10-point likert scale: 3.25, SD±1.97). The findings from Study 1 illustrate that the proscription to not harm others—predicted by our survey sample to be a powerful force in real life moral decisions—in fact has surprisingly little influence when potential significant personal gain is at stake. It seems that when a decision is entirely hypothetical, the influence of breaking a moral imperative (it is morally wrong to harm others, especially for monetary gain) is more compelling than the influence of imaginary monetary benefit. In comparison, when this substantial monetary self-benefit becomes tangible and real, it appears that the aversion to harming others is no longer the most salient feature within the decision-making space. Imaginary moral scenarios, stripped of contextual and motivational cues like concrete incentives and consequences, seem to maximise people’s opportunity to adhere to moral duties, such as not harming others (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). In contrast, when the moral choice is made real, it appears that the influence of actual ‘money on the table’ is the overriding influence. These data demonstrate that there can be fundamental differences between how we assume people will act (as indexed by the survey data) and how they actually act, and that introducing real outcome contingencies can drastically change moral behaviour. One potential limitation of the experimental framework used in Study 1b is that subjects in the Real PvG condition were recruited under the pretext of completing a psychology economic task, while subjects in the hypothetical Scenario PvG condition were told to imagine partaking in a psychology experiment where they must make decisions about shocks and money. However, the effect size of the differences between conditions was sufficiently large that, while this issue must be taken seriously, we feel that it cannot fully account for the data. Another issue that merits careful consideration is the believability of the Real PvG paradigm. It is important that participants were not keeping more money in the real condition simply because they did not believe that real shocks were being administered to the Receiver, and therefore felt that there was no disincentive to keep the money. There are a number of reasons why we feel that this is unlikely to be the case. First, we were careful to probe participants about their belief in the paradigm. We felt confident that they would respond to this question honestly because if they had behaved in a self-serving manner due to the assumption that the shocks were not real, we reasoned that they would want to inform us of this to avoid being judged as ‘immoral’. 2 In fact, subjects’ comments to us after the task, but before debriefing, indicate that subjects felt a genuine motivational conflict. For example, one subjected stated: “I struggled with what to do. I wanted the money but I didn’t want to hurt him. I decided that he could take a little pain and I could make a little money. Somewhere in the middle. But I felt guilty”. Another said: “I was curious to see how ruthless I could be. I was happy to see that I could control myself. I wanted the money. I tried the highest shock first. I wanted to see the reaction. And then took it from there.” 2 Furthermore, we excluded from the analyses participants who expressed any disbelief in the protocol. Indeed, in supplementary analyses (see above) we focused only on participants who scored very lowly on the belief scale, and found comparable results to the analyses with the initial sample. Additionally, there was no support for a significant association between belief ratings and Money Kept. Second, we would also reiterate that we went to great lengths to enhance the believability of the task using carefully scripted experimental procedures, ensuring that the participants met and interacted with the Receiver, and viewed the room where the shocks would be delivered. We also delivered a sample shock to each subject. Finally, although pre-recorded, the video feedback participants saw was footage of actual shocks being delivered. 3 In addition, the nature of feedback during debriefing suggested that subjects—after being told the true nature of the study—truly believed the paradigm: “I am really upset that it is not real. If I had known it was real I would have kept all the money” and “I can’t believe it is not real. I found the shock painful. So I know that he must have been in real pain.” 3 Third, we sought to address the concern that prior knowledge of Milgram’s obedience studies, which used bogus shock administration, might compromise the present study. We therefore took care to ask participants about their knowledge of the Milgram study and to examine whether this influenced the results. Knowledge of the Milgram experiment (six subjects) did not appear to have been a factor in their responses. For example, one subject said: “Yea I know about Milgram. And I thought about that when you were describing the experiment, but I thought you couldn’t do that anymore so I knew these shocks were real. Plus I felt it [the shock] and I saw myself being recorded when I was in the other room.” In sum, we feel confident that for the participants in our analysis sample from the Real PvG condition, disbelief in the paradigm was not a significant issue. One possible account of the findings from Study 1 is that simple hypothetical moral scenarios maximise the need for participants to mentally simulate the pros and cons for a given decision. In such situations, the impact of ingrained moral proscriptions (even when there is knowledge that the decision is hypothetical) is arguably far stronger than the impact of imaginary money. In contrast, in the real situation, the need for mental simulation is minimised, allowing the actual motive power of real money and real harm to yield their influence such that if the money is sufficient, the harm will be administered. This analysis is consistent with Loewenstein’s work on the hot–cold empathy gap (Van Boven & Loewenstein, 2005) and with Damasio’s somatic marker hypothesis (Dunn, Dalgleish, & Lawrence, 2006), both of which emphasise the differential influence of emotion-arousing features of a decision space in real decisions compared to hypothetical ones. It follows from these arguments that reducing the need for mental simulation on the PvG task, even in situations where the money and harm remain hypothetical, should shift participants’ behaviour away from that exhibited in the simple scenario condition of Study 1b and closer to that exhibited in the Real PvG task (Wilson et al., 2000). 3 STUDY 2: Enriching the context Based on this reasoning, in Study 2 we created three additional hypothetical PvG tasks, with stepped increases in the richness of their situational and contextual cues: a longer written version of the hypothetical task used in Study 1b (Enriched Scenario PvG), a computer-administered version where participants actually worked through the 20 trials knowing that the task was hypothetical but did not meet the Receiver or experience a sample shock (Trial-by-Trial PvG), and a ‘near-real’ version that was identical to the Real PvG in every respect except that the money and shocks were completely imaginary (Near-Real PvG). Our hypothesis was that there would be a significant increase in Money Kept across the 4 versions of the hypothetical PvG (the simple scenario from Study 1b and the three new versions) as the versions reduced the scope and need for mental simulation when making a moral decision. 3.1 Methods 3.1.1 Participants In Study 2, 93 subjects completed the three new hypothetical versions of the PvG task: 15 subjects (mean age 25.8, and SD±1.1; 7 females) completed the Near-Real PvG, 18 subjects (mean age 23.8, and SD±1.0; 12 females) completed the Trial-by-Trial PvG, and 63 subjects (mean age 29.0, and SD±2.2; 41 females) completed the Enriched Scenario PvG. 3.1.2 Hypothetical PvG conditions 3.1.2.1 The Near-Real PvG This condition required subjects to complete the same task as in the Real PvG (see Study 1b). Deciders still met the Receiver and experienced the same low-level shock. The only differences were that Deciders were not endowed with money and were told to simply imagine making the relevant decision. Thus, in this condition there was no video feedback but instead a blue screen was presented for 4s each trial. 3.1.2.2 Trial-by-Trial PVG This version was the same as the Near Real PvG except that subjects did not have the experience of meeting the Receiver or receiving a sample shock. Again, subjects were asked to imagine that £20 was at stake and that another participant was receiving the chosen shocks. A blue screen was also presented for 4s during the video feedback portion of each trial. 3.1.2.3 Enriched Scenario PvG Subjects were presented with a contextually rich written version of the PvG dilemma in which more information was provided than in the simple scenario in Study 1a. 3.2 Results and discussion The data from the three new hypothetical scenarios are combined with the data from the simple scenario in Study 1b. The groups of participants across the four conditions were matched on age and gender ratio (age: F(3,118)=0.92, p =0.43; gender: Chi-square=2.9, p =0.39). The data from the four hypothetical PvG conditions are shown in Fig 2b. ANOVA revealed a clear and significant effect of context, such that systematically enriching the situational context, and thus increasing the ecological validity of the dilemma, reduced the gap between hypothetical moral choices and real moral action [(see Fig 2a), F(3,118)=16.24, p <0.0001, partial η 2 =0.29; with each condition significantly differing from its neighbour: post hoc LSD tests Ps<0.05]. A comparison between the Near-Real PvG condition in Study 2 and the Real PvG in Study 1b revealed no significant difference between them [t(33)=−0.11, p =0.91]. This supports our contention that the more a hypothetical PvG task contextually resembles the Real PvG, the more people are willing to augment their personal gain at the expense of harming another. 4 General discussion Classical research on morality has shown that the proscription not to harm others is a deeply ingrained moral principal (Greene et al., 2001). This was reflected in participants’ predictions about moral decisions to inflict harm in exchange for significant monetary gain: Study 1a showed overwhelmingly that participants believed people would be much less likely to inflict harm for money when the consequences were real than when they were simply hypothetical. However, a test examining these predictions (Study 1b) revealed the opposite result: in contrast to the survey predictions, participants were significantly more likely to inflict harm for monetary gain under real conditions than they were under hypothetical conditions. We reasoned that the influence of harm aversion diminishes as the impact of other motivational forces—such as significant financial gain—become more salient. These findings imply that not only are subjects unable to accurately judge outcomes of moral behaviour, but under certain conditions they also make starkly different moral choices in real, compared to hypothetical, contexts. To explain why real moral choices radically contradict the responses generated by the type of decontextualized hypothetical moral scenarios used in Study 1b, we explored whether enriching the contextual information available to subjects would influence their decisions (Study 2). We found that the more spartan the contextual information, and hence the more room people have for mental simulation when addressing a hypothetical moral problem, the more subjects’ responses diverged from real behaviour. This strongly suggests that the underspecified and impoverished nature of hypothetical moral probes is unable to capture the complex social, emotional and motivational pressures inherent to real moral decisions. This is consistent with work in other psychological domains (Gilbert & Wilson, 2007; Wilson et al., 2000), showing that simulating future choices can be markedly inconsistent with reality. Accordingly, we found that enhancing the specificity and ecological validity of situational cues in hypothetical moral probes—thereby encapsulating the complex motivational forces at work in real decisions—can bring hypothetical choices in-line with real moral behaviour. Therefore, we suggest that during simple hypothetical moral decisions, subjects are unable to access the contextual-dependent knowledge experienced during real moral choices, and instead rely on their most salient motivation: to uphold the moral duty to avoid harming another. Taken together, these findings have a number of important implications. First, and most strikingly, peoples’ real moral choices drastically contradict the responses generated by simple hypothetical moral probes. Second, these data suggest that our moral beliefs may have a much weaker impact on our decision-making if the context is enriched with other compelling motivational forces, such as the presence of a significant self-gain. This raises questions about whether hypothetical moral decisions generated in response to decontextualized scenarios, act as a good proxy for real moral choices. Even though moral ideals are strongly ingrained within society, actual moral choices seem exceptionally labile and profoundly influenced by the tangibility of rewards, situational cues and concrete consequences. While the aim of the studies reported here was to examine considerations of harm against self-benefit under both real and hypothetical conditions, many questions arise from this data: what are the cognitive mechanisms driving self-serving behaviour? How do individual differences contribute to the moral decision-making process? What other motivations besides harm aversion influence our sensitivity to self-benefit? Future studies designed to disentangle the various cognitive mechanisms driving moral motivations is an important next step in further elucidating the nature of moral behaviour.

Highlights ► Deaf native signers, early and late learners judged BSL sentence grammaticality. ► Early learners performed worse the later they were exposed to BSL. ► Late learners’ performance was not affected by age of learning BSL. ► Unique effect of age of learning BSL found in early learners. ► Prelingually deaf late learners may benefit from first language competence in English. Abstract Age of acquisition (AoA) effects have been used to support the notion of a critical period for first language acquisition. In this study, we examine AoA effects in deaf British Sign Language (BSL) users via a grammaticality judgment task. When English reading performance and nonverbal IQ are factored out, results show that accuracy of grammaticality judgement decreases as AoA increases, until around age 8, thus showing the unique effect of AoA on grammatical judgement in early learners. No such effects were found in those who acquired BSL after age 8. These late learners appear to have first language proficiency in English instead, which may have been used to scaffold learning of BSL as a second language later in life. Keywords Deaf British Sign Language Critical period Acquisition Grammaticality judgement Syntax 1 Introduction According to a hypothesis originally proposed by Lenneberg (1967), there is a critical (or sensitive) period for acquisition of a first language (L1) – i.e., the first accessible language to which an individual is exposed, typically from birth – linked to neural plasticity which decreases as an individual grows older. This hypothesis has also been extended to apply to subsequent, second language (L2) acquisition. Based on a variety of studies which have examined L2 acquisition (e.g., Birdsong, 1999b), it does indeed seem clear that earlier exposure to a second language leads to more native-like competence of that language, although whether an actual critical period exists for L2 acquisition due to changes in the brain is unclear. Some have argued for a critical period for L2 acquisition, based on studies showing that native-like proficiency declines when the age of acquisition is after puberty (e.g., Coppieters, 1987; Eubank & Gregg, 1999; Johnson & Newport, 1989; Weber-Fox & Neville, 1999). However, others have argued against a critical period based on studies showing that individuals acquiring a second language may achieve near-native levels of proficiency at any age (e.g., Birdsong, 1992; Bongaerts, 1999; Hakuta, Bialystok, & Wiley, 2003; White & Genesee, 1996). 3 For useful overviews covering key literature on the critical period hypothesis in second language acquisition, see Birdsong (1999a), Hyltenstam and Abrahamsson (2005) and Harley and Wang (1997). 3 Unlike the L2 critical period hypothesis, the L1 critical period hypothesis is untestable in the general population, because all typically-developing, hearing children have access to a first language from the surrounding language community. Evidence to support the L1 critical period hypothesis comes primarily from two groups with atypical language development. One group is children who have been deprived of language via isolation from humans early in life. One well-known case is Genie, a child who was isolated for the first 13years of her life. After she was discovered and exposed to English at age 13, Genie exhibited better lexical than syntactic development and better comprehension than production. Her rate of language acquisition was overall very slow as well, and she had long-lasting problems with particular grammatical structures. However, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about language development from cases such as Genie, not only due to their extreme rarity, but also because their isolation has broad consequences on all aspects of cognitive and social development, not only their linguistic development; thus any effects of age of language acquisition are confounded with these other variables (Curtiss, 1977; Skuse, 1988). The second group which provides evidence for a critical period for L1 acquisition are profoundly deaf children born into hearing families. In North America, for example, language acquisition and transmission for deaf individuals differs substantially from that of hearing individuals, with a maximum of only 5–10% of deaf children acquiring a sign language natively from deaf or hearing signing parents (Mitchell & Karchmer, 2004). This minority of deaf children who are exposed to a sign language from birth acquire that sign language in much the same way that hearing children acquire their native spoken language and with similar maturational milestones (Newport & Meier, 1985; Petitto & Marantette, 1991). The remaining 90–95% of deaf children are born to hearing families who typically do not use a sign language, instead focusing on teaching the child spoken language. Such an approach has had typically highly variable outcomes. Spoken language acquisition, if it does occur, is significantly delayed in many deaf children compared to hearing children, depending not only on the degree and kind of hearing loss but also the child’s home and school environments, their intelligence and time spent reading (Blamey, 2003; Sarant, Holt, Dowell, Rickards, & Blamey, 2009). In terms of the school environment, there have traditionally been three main types of communication that schools use in the education of deaf students: auditory-oral methods (where the focus is on speech, listening and/or speechreading), bimodal methods (where artificial sign systems are used to represent spoken language, e.g., Signed English or Sign Supported English in the UK), and natural sign languages such as British Sign Language (BSL). During the twentieth century, oral and bimodal methods were most prevalent worldwide until the 1980s which saw the introduction of bilingual–bicultural approaches to deaf education in some countries, due to changes in awareness of and attitudes towards the language and culture of deaf communities and the recognition that deaf children are equally as capable of learning as their hearing peers (Swanwick & Gregory, 2007). The basic premise of bilingual–bicultural education was that full access to education via a natural sign language would facilitate age-appropriate language and cognition; this would then provide the basis for a transition to text-based literacy in the majority spoken language (Cummins, 1989; Johnson, Liddell, & Erting, 1989; Lane, Hoffmeister, & Bahan, 1996). Bilingual–cultural models of deaf education are still popular today. However, a lack of empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of bilingual approaches, along with technological advances such as newborn hearing screening and cochlear implants, both pose possible challenges to the continuation of bilingual programmes for deaf children in the UK and worldwide (Mayer & Leigh, 2010; Powers, 2002). Whether or not spoken language proficiency is successfully attained, some degree of proficiency in the surrounding spoken language via reading and writing can be achieved by some deaf individuals. However, such successes with literacy are again highly variable and not common. The average reading age for the adult deaf population in the UK and the USA is generally believed to be around 8 or 9years, based on data from Conrad (1979) and Traxler (2000). Regardless of their success or failure to acquire spoken or written language, many deaf individuals from non-signing families may begin to use a sign language. This may occur only later in childhood when they encounter signing in school, or even much later after having left school. Some of these individuals can be considered to have delayed acquisition of a sign language as L1 (i.e., those for whom acquisition of the surrounding spoken language as an L1 has clearly failed). However, many deaf individuals have some degree of proficiency in the surrounding spoken language, so determining true cases of delayed L1 acquisition of a sign language, as opposed to second language (L2) acquisition of a sign language after successful acquisition of the surrounding spoken/written language as L1, can be a challenge. Distinguishing these cases of late L1 versus L2 sign language acquisition is crucial for making claims about the L1 critical period hypothesis, since it is widely believed that first language acquisition differs from second language(s) in that the former typically leads to native proficiency. Although “the earlier, the better” applies in both cases, early acquisition is considered relatively less important for ultimate attainment of L2 skills compared to L1. Also, some research suggests that second language acquisition is not a good test for the notion of a critical period for language in any case, because the outcome of second language acquisition may be influenced by circumstances of first language acquisition (Werker & Lalonde, 1988). Therefore, first language acquisition is a better test of the notion of critical periods overall. Acquisition of a first language from birth will ultimately lead to native proficiency, whereas delayed first language acquisition is unlikely to lead to complete acquisition at all, much less native/near-native proficiency. However, as noted above, cases of delayed first language acquisition of a spoken language are rare and confounded with other variables. Deaf individuals acquiring a signed language at varying ages provide a better testing ground for hypotheses about L1 critical periods. The current study examines the effects of age of acquisition on sensitivity to grammatical judgement in BSL. BSL is a natural sign language used by the deaf community in the United Kingdom (Sutton-Spence & Woll, 1999). Many aspects of its linguistic structure at the levels of phonology, morphology and syntax are different from English. BSL is also unrelated to, and for the most part mutually unintelligible with, most other sign languages, including American Sign Language (ASL) and Irish Sign Language (ISL). Many previous studies have shown age of acquisition effects within sign languages such as ASL and BSL, at phonological, morphological, and syntactic levels. Mayberry and colleagues (Mayberry & Eichen, 1991; Mayberry & Fischer, 1989) found that native signers outperformed non-native signers of ASL in sentence recall and sentence shadowing tasks, while Emmorey and colleagues (Emmorey, 1991; Emmorey, Bellugi, Friederici, & Horn, 1995; Emmorey, Corina, & Bellugi, 1995) found age of acquisition effects in ASL morphological repetition priming, lexical decision, sign monitoring, and probe recognition tasks. Differences have also been found between native and non-native signers in brain activation. MacSweeney, Waters, Brammer, Woll, and Goswami (2008) reported greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in deaf non-native signers than native signers during a BSL phonological judgement task, while Newman, Bavalier, Corina, Jezzard, and Neville (2002) found more right hemisphere angular gyrus activation in hearing, native signers of ASL (i.e., ASL-English bilinguals) than in hearing late learners of ASL. These data have been used in support of the L1 critical period hypothesis. However, some of these studies did not distinguish between first language and second language acquisition, because they did not control for the extent to which the non-native signers were proficient in a spoken language before acquisition of a sign language, an important issue when considering whether their sign language was an L1 or an L2. This is a crucial issue when considering whether the results are relevant to critical periods for L1 acquisition. Some other studies have recognised the need to distinguish between L1 and L2 acquisition by attempting to ensure that their non-native signer participants had a sign language, rather than a spoken/written language, as L1. For example, Newport (1990) reported that native signers outscored non-native signers in a variety of production and comprehension tests of ASL morphology and syntax. 4 With regard to syntax, Newport (1990) found no differences between native and non-native signers in the comprehension of basic word order. This was measured by a task where signers watched simple ASL sentences with three different word orders (SVO; OSV; VOS) combined with different non-manual markers to signal changes in information structure. Participants were asked to choose one of two pictures in which the subject and object were reversed. Newport (1990) used the word order task from the draft Test Battery for ASL Morphology and Syntax (Supalla et al., n.d.) which included practice items that demonstrated correct responses (Schembri et al., 2002). It is possible that the non-native signers could have learned the rule from these practice examples. 4 Morford, Grieve-Smith, MacFarlane, Staley, and Waters (2008) found age of acquisition effects in perception of handshape and place of articulation in lexical signs of ASL. Specifically, deaf native signers (with exposure to ASL from birth) showed higher discrimination with handshapes that were on the periphery of the category prototype or which straddled the category boundary, compared to deaf late learners of ASL (age of acquisition ranging from 10 to 18years old). Mayberry (1993) directly compared L1 acquisition with L2 sign language acquisition effects, by comparing sentence recall in deaf ASL signers who reported acquiring ASL as a first language at various ages – from birth, early (between ages 5 and 8), and late (between ages 9 and 13) – with postlingually deaf individuals who had acquired English as L1 and acquired ASL as L2 after becoming deaf later in childhood. In this study, Mayberry found age of learning L1 effects: native signers performed better than early learners who performed better than late learners. Those who had acquired ASL as an L2 performed more similarly to the early L1 learners than the late L1 signers. From this, Mayberry concluded that L1 acquisition of a sign language (in prelingually deaf individuals) differs from L2 acquisition of a sign language (in postlingually deaf individuals). Mayberry, Lock and colleagues (2003, 2002) extended these findings by examining L2 English proficiency in deaf L1 signers of ASL (with varying ages of acquisition) compared with L2 English proficiency in native speakers of spoken French, German, Italian and Greek. Their findings indicated that deaf native/near-native ASL signers (who had acquired English between ages 3 and 7 as L2) and hearing non-signers (who had acquired English between ages 6 and 13 as L2) performed better on English tests than deaf ASL signers who had acquired English between ages 6 and 13 as essentially a delayed first language. 5 Mayberry and Lock (2003) claimed that the group of deaf people with a delayed first language in their study were not exposed to any accessible language at all until age 6, at which time they were enrolled in schools which used Total Communication, a bimodal strategy where signs (some from ASL, some invented for representing English grammatical morphemes) are produced in English word order. At these schools they were also taught English via lipreading, reading and writing. 5 Finally, Boudreault and Mayberry (2006) examined grammatical judgement in signers who had acquired ASL as a first language from birth, early childhood, or later in life, finding that as delay in age of exposure increased, performance in grammatical judgement decreased, similar to Mayberry (1993). Taken together, these studies on deaf populations strongly suggest that age of first language acquisition of a sign language affects ultimate proficiency in that language. However, in all of these studies, the status of ASL or BSL as the first language of the non-native signers was based on their inability to use spoken English (Boudreault & Mayberry, 2006; Mayberry, 1993; Mayberry & Lock, 2003) or their “limited knowledge of English” (Morford et al., 2008, p. 43) as determined by self-report, or their “limited skills in English” with no indication of how this was determined (Newport, 1990, p. 14). The problem with relying solely on self-report for determining L1 in deaf signers is that deaf individuals are typically bilingual to some degree (even if only a small degree) in the surrounding spoken and/or written language (Ann, 2001; Grosjean, 1992), and there is great heterogeneity in age of both L1 and L2 acquisition, as discussed above. Determining the degree of competence in spoken/written language via only self-report can be difficult, particularly in late learners who would have had more time to potentially develop proficiency in the spoken/written language. In most of these studies (MacSweeney et al., 2008, being one exception), measures which could have more convincingly eliminated the possibility of English as L1, such as reading ability (either via formal assessment or self-report), were not reported. In the current study, we examine age of L1 acquisition effects in a sign language by employing a grammaticality judgment task based on the ASL task designed by Boudreault and Mayberry (2006). Crucially, we take into account English reading performance and nonverbal IQ, in addition to self-reported demographic information from participants, in order to more directly assess the critical period hypothesis. Because our study is based closely on materials developed in ASL by Boudreault and Mayberry (2006), we first outline their methods and results. 2 ASL Grammaticality Judgement Task (Boudreault & Mayberry, 2006) Boudreault and Mayberry (2006) designed an ASL grammaticality judgement task to test whether age of acquisition had differential effects with regard to off-line grammaticality judgement of different syntactic structures. They selected various morphosyntactic structures based on their reported developmental timecourse in ASL acquisition. This included ASL structures which have been claimed to be acquired relatively early (by age 2;6–3;0), such as basic word order with plain verbs (Pichler, 2002) and negation and ‘agreement’ verbs 6 Note that we use the term ‘agreement verb’ here for ease of comparison with the literature, but we accept the analysis proposed by Liddell (2000) that these forms do not actually mark for person agreement. 6 (Anderson & Reilly, 1997; Meier, 1987). Boudreault and Mayberry also included structures reportedly acquired later such as wh-questions, relative clauses, and ‘classifier’ constructions. 7 For a review of ‘classifier’ constructions in signed languages, and issues surrounding the terminology to refer to them, see Schembri (2003). 7 Although elements of wh-questions and classifier constructions first occur at ages similar to simple structures (Anderson & Reilly, 2002), adult-like use of these structures in ASL has been found to follow a protracted timecourse with full mastery occurring between 4 and 9years old (Lillo-Martin, 2000; Supalla, 1982). Boudreault and Mayberry conjectured that, although the acquisition of relative clauses has not been studied in ASL in any depth, the structural similarity between relative clauses and conditional structures (acquired by around 8years of age, cf. Reilly, McIntyre, & Bellugi, 1990) suggests that relative clauses are also likely to be acquired late. The stimulus set consisted of 14 pairs of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences based on each of six syntactic structures: simple sentences, sentences with negation, sentences with agreement verbs, questions, relative clause structures and classifier constructions. All ungrammatical stimulus sentences were created from the grammatical stimulus sentences by moving a constituent to an incorrect position in the sentence. Participants were instructed to focus on detecting errors in the structure of the stimuli, including non-manual marking (e.g., changes in facial expression), sign order and/or the use of space. The participants in Boudreault and Mayberry’s study were 10 native signers of ASL (deaf signers from deaf families), 10 early learners of ASL (reported age of acquisition between 5 and 7years of age) and 10 late learners of ASL (reported age of acquisition between 8 and 13years of age). All participants used ASL as their preferred language and had been using ASL for at least 13years. Further demographic information from the ASL participants, such as mean and range of ages of acquisition (AoA) and mean and range of ages and length of ASL use, are shown in Table 1 . Importantly, Boudreault and Mayberry claimed that all of their participants were L1, not L2 learners of ASL: “No participant reported successful acquisition of a spoken language prior to learning ASL and none reported the ability to navigate everyday life through the exclusive use of speech and speech-reading” (p. 613). This latter criterion, determined by self-report only, was crucial for establishing that all of their participants acquired ASL as a first language. Boudreault and Mayberry’s (2006) results showed large effects of age of acquisition on response accuracy (as shown in Table 1), but not response latency. Age of acquisition effects did not interact with the effects of morphosyntactic structure, although negative structures were most accurate overall and relative clauses the least accurate overall. With response accuracy, Boudreault and Mayberry found an interaction between grammatical status (i.e., grammatical versus ungrammatical) and AoA and also between grammatical status and syntactic structure. That is, participants made more errors with ungrammatical than grammatical stimuli across all structures except negative and classifier constructions, and this was particularly pronounced in the early and late learners. Thus, Boudreault and Mayberry found strong age of acquisition effects on accuracy, and also an interaction between grammaticality and AoA for most structures. They concluded from this that delayed L1 acquisition affects the ultimate acquisition of morphosyntax in ASL. Combined with Mayberry’s previous work (Mayberry & Eichen, 1991; Mayberry & Fischer, 1989), they argued that their results showed that delayed L1 acquisition affects all subsequent language acquisition. 3 BSL Grammaticality Judgement Task (BSLGJT) The aims of the current study were twofold: (a) to test Boudreault and Mayberry’s (2006) claims made about delayed L1 acquisition of sign language morphosyntax using a BSL version of their ASL Grammaticality Judgement Task, thus exploring this claim for the first time in a behavioural study with a sign language other than ASL, and (b) to develop the BSL Grammaticality Judgement Task into a screening tool for assessing BSL skills in deaf adults, since no such tools existed when this study commenced. In addition to these two main aims, we also wished to rule out other possible explanations for Boudreault and Mayberry’s findings for ASL. We therefore included measures of nonverbal IQ and reading, which we regarded a proxy measure of English language proficiency. By factoring out reading proficiency and also nonverbal IQ, we argue we are more able to directly assess the effects of first language acquisition. Unlike Boudreault and Mayberry (as we explain in more detail later), we opted to include some participants who appeared to have L1 proficiency in English in our late learner group, as deaf individuals reporting that they had acquired BSL as an L1 during or after late childhood were difficult to recruit for this study. We assumed that our reading measures would correctly identify those signers with higher levels of English proficiency. The six constructions included in the task by Boudreault and Mayberry – simple sentences, sentences with negation, sentences with agreement verbs, questions, relative clause structures and classifier constructions – have also been identified in many other sign languages (Cecchetto, Geraci, & Zucchi, 2006; Mathur & Rathmann, 2010; Pfau & Steinbach, 2005; Zeshan, 2006; Zwitserlood, in press), including BSL (Sutton-Spence & Woll, 1999). There are some ways in which these BSL syntactic constructions differ from those in ASL. One example is negation. ASL has a general negative adverbial sign not which is used in addition to a range of negative manual signs including signs such as never, nothing, not-yet, negative modals (can’t, won’t) etc., in addition to non-manual marking (i.e., headshake) (Wood, 1999). In BSL, observation suggests that negation is more commonly expressed either only non-manually (i.e., with a headshake) or via other negative manual signs such as never, nothing, not-yet, can’t, won’t, etc., rather than by a general manual negative adverbial sign not. 8 Sutton-Spence and Woll (1999) note that a negative adverbial sign not (identical in form to ASL not) is used in Scotland and in some more English-influenced varieties of BSL. 8 Marking of relative clauses in ASL and BSL also differs. ASL uses the manual signs that and self as relative pronouns along with non-manual and prosodic marking. BSL uses similar non-manual and prosodic cues to mark relative clauses (Cormier, in press). However, to our knowledge, BSL does not have relative pronouns like ASL. Aside from these differences, these structures function essentially the same way in BSL and ASL. 9 The fact that some of these structures are slightly different across the two languages means that studying grammaticality judgement of BSL sentences, compared to ASL sentences, helps to provide much needed cross-linguistic evidence of age of acquisition effects in sign languages. 9 Therefore, in order to try to replicate the age of acquisition effects that Boudreault and Mayberry (2006) had found with these types of sentences in ASL, we used these same sentence types for BSL. In terms of children’s development, the acquisition of syntactic structures in BSL has not been studied to the same extent as the acquisition of ASL syntax. It does seem clear that deaf children acquiring BSL are able to master verb agreement and classifier constructions around the same ages as deaf children acquiring ASL (Morgan, Barriere, & Woll, 2006), so it is not unreasonable to assume the timecourses for the other constructions are similar for BSL as well (i.e., earlier acquisition of basic word order in simple sentences, negation and agreement structures compared to later acquisition of questions, classifier constructions and relative clause structures). 4 Method 4.1 BSL stimuli An initial set of 168 BSL stimuli were created by the second author of this paper (a fluent hearing signer and linguist) in consultation with deaf native signers, modelled on the ASL stimuli from Boudreault and Mayberry (2006). The stimulus set contained 14 pairs of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences based on six syntactic structures: simple sentences, and sentences with negation, agreement verbs, wh-questions, relative clauses and classifier constructions. The ungrammatical sentences were created by moving a constituent to an incorrect position in the sentence. All stimulus clauses were 6–9 morphemes in length. (Meaningful uses of non-manual marking and of spatial locations associated with referents were counted as ‘morphemes’ in the BSL study). 4.1.1 Simple sentences Fourteen pairs of simple sentences all contained plain, uninflected verbs, as in (1a). No agreement verbs or classifier constructions were used in these sentences. The ungrammatical version of each grammatical sentence was produced by moving the verb into an incorrect position in the subject noun phrase, as in (1b). (1a) Simple sentence (grammatical) 10 Examples in (1a)–(9b) consist of a word-for-sign English gloss of each sign (in small capitals). These glosses are not the only possible English equivalents for many of these signs, but are the most appropriate translations for these sentences. Above the gloss is notation of any grammatical non-manual markers and their scope: br=brow raise (used in marking topics and relative clauses), hs=headshake (used for marking negation), and bf=brow furrow (used in marking wh-questions). Although the status of person in sign languages is controversial (see Cormier (in press) for an overview), for ease of exposition, person ‘inflections’ are marked here with numbers corresponding to the traditional notions of first, second and third persons. English translations are given underneath the glossed sentences. Because the (b) examples are all ungrammatical, English translations for these are only approximate. 10 fifty year ago most man smoke ‘Fifty years ago, most men were smokers.’ (Supplementary Video 1) (1b) Simple sentence (ungrammatical) * fifty smoke year ago most man ‘Fifty smoke years ago, most men.’ (Supplementary Video 2) 4.1.2 Negated sentences Fourteen pairs of negated sentences contained plain, uninflected verbs. No agreement verbs or classifier constructions were used in these sentences. Seven of these pairs had only non-manual marking of negation (e.g., headshake), and the ungrammatical sentence was produced by moving the non-manual marking from the verb phrase to the subject noun phrase, as in (2a). The other seven pairs used a manual negator sign (a negative form of a modal such as can’t or won’t), along with the non-manual marker of negation, as in (3a). The ungrammatical sentences were produced by moving the modal and the non-manual marking to an incorrect position in the object noun phrase, as in (2b) and (3b). (2a) Negative sentence with non-manual marking only (grammatical) ________________hs poss-3 sister steal poss-2 camera ‘Her/his sister didn’t steal your camera.’ (Supplementary Video 3) (2b) Negative sentence with non-manual marking only (ungrammatical) __________hs * poss-3 sister steal poss-2 camera ‘Not her/his sister steal your camera.’ (Supplementary Video 4) (3a) Negative sentence with negative modal and non-manual marking (grammatical) ________________hs pro-1 can’t fix poss-2 car ‘I can’t fix your car.’ (Supplementary Video 5) (3b) Negative sentence with negative modal and non-manual marking (ungrammatical) _______hs * pro-1 fix poss-2 can’t car ‘I fix your can’t car.’ (Supplementary Video 6) 4.1.3 Agreement verb sentences Fourteen pairs of sentences contained an agreement verb as in (4a), with the ungrammatical sentence produced by moving the verb to an incorrect position in the object or subject noun phrase as in (4b). These sentences included sentences with double agreement verbs (in which the verb sign moves from a location associated with the subject argument to one associated with the object) and sentences with single agreement verbs (in which the verb sign moves from the body and/or a neutral location to a location associated with the object argument). No classifier constructions were used in these sentences. (4a) Agreement verb sentence (grammatical) ________br sign class poss-1 student++ reject-3 ‘My students couldn’t be bothered with the sign class.’ (Supplementary Video 7) (4b) Agreement verb sentence (ungrammatical) __br * sign reject-3 class poss-1 student++ ‘Sign reject class my students.’ (Supplementary Video 8) 4.1.4 Wh-questions Fourteen pairs of sentences contained a wh-question sign, with seven pairs involving the use of plain verb as in (5a) and seven involving an agreement verb as in (6a). No classifier constructions were used in these sentences. The ungrammatical sentences were produced by moving the question sign to an incorrect position in the object or subject noun phrase, as in (5b) and (6b). We opted to use only clauses including wh-question signs for this section, whereas the original ASL task included both wh- and yes–no interrogative constructions (the latter were erroneously referred to as wh-questions in Boudreault & Mayberry, 2006). The wh-questions were marked with a wh-question sign and the associated non-manual marking (e.g., furrowed brows). The yes–no questions had only non-manual marking associated with yes–no questions (e.g., raised brows). In the ASL task, the non-manually marked yes–no questions were made ungrammatical by changing the scope of the required non-manual element, but as the syntactic versus prosodic nature of these non-manual features is in dispute in the literature (e.g., Sandler & Lillo-Martin, 2006), we decided not to include sentences of this type. (5a) Example: Wh-question with plain verb (grammatical) ___________br _________bf new house key who forget ‘Who forgot the key to the new house?’ (Supplementary Video 9) (5b) Example: Wh-question with plain verb (ungrammatical) _______________br _____bf * new who house key forget ‘Why/when/how did the new who house key forget?’ (Supplementary Video 10) (6a) Wh-question with agreement verb (grammatical) ____bf deaf school 3-post-1 letter when ‘When did/will the deaf school post me the letter?’ (Supplementary Video 11) (6b) Wh-question with agreement verb (ungrammatical) ____bf * deaf when school 3-post-1 letter ‘The deaf when school posted/will post me a letter.’ (Supplementary Video 12) 4.1.5 Relative clause sentences Fourteen pairs of sentences consisted of a noun phrase containing a relative clause, marked with the appropriate non-manual marking, followed by a verb phrase, with seven pairs using a plain verb as in (7a) and seven using an agreement verb in the verb phrase as in (8a). No classifier constructions were used in these sentences. The ungrammatical items were produced by swapping the order of the verb phrase relative to the subject noun phrase, as in (7b) and (8b). The equivalent sentences in the ASL set included seven relative clauses using the relative pronoun that or self; as noted above, these constructions do not appear to have equivalent forms in BSL. (7a) Relative clause sentence with plain verb (grammatical) _____________________________br woman cancel meeting yesterday arrive ‘The woman who cancelled the meeting yesterday has arrived.’ (Supplementary Video 13) (7b) Example: Relative clause sentence with plain verb (ungrammatical) ___________________________br * arrive woman cancel meeting yesterday ‘Arrive did the woman cancel the meeting yesterday?’ (Supplementary Video 14) (8a) Relative clause sentence with agreement verb (grammatical) __________________br woman eat chocolate 3-give-1 two-pound ‘The woman who ate the chocolate gave me £2.’ (Supplementary Video 15) (8b) Example: Relative clause sentence with agreement verb (ungrammatical) __________________br * 3-give-1 two-pound woman eat chocolate ‘He/she gave/will give me two pounds did/will the woman eat the chocolate?’ (Supplementary Video 16) 4.1.6 Classifier construction sentences Fourteen pairs of sentences consisted of a noun phrase representing the ground argument followed by a noun phrase representing the figure argument and finally a verb phrase containing a classifier construction describing a motion event – specifically, an entity classifier construction, in which the hand represents a whole or part of an entity such as a person, animal or a vehicle, as in (9a). The ungrammatical items were produced by swapping the order of the verb phrase relative to the ground and figure noun phrases, as in (9b). Boudreault and Mayberry (2006) note that classifier sentences were the most difficult to make ungrammatical for the ASL stimuli – the same was true for BSL. Boudreault and Mayberry attribute this to a lack of understanding about the use of classifier constructions compared to other structures, although it may be that constituent orders with classifier sentences are more variable than in other syntactic constructions (e.g., Johnston, Vermeerbergen, Schembri, & Leeson, 2007). The sentences containing the classifier constructions were made ungrammatical by moving the verb phrase containing the classifier construction before the ground and figure noun phrases. (9a) Classifier construction sentence (grammatical) bicycle boy cl:v-fall-off-cl:b ‘The boy fell off the bicycle.’ (Supplementary Video 17) (9b) Classifier construction sentence (ungrammatical) * cl:v-fall-off-cl:b bicycle boy ‘Fall off the bicycle the boy.’ (Supplementary Video 18) 4.2 Testing equipment and materials The BSL stimuli were produced by a deaf native BSL signer model who was filmed with a digital video camera. During filming, the model was monitored by three fluent signers of BSL to ensure that sentences looked as natural as possible; any sentences which were thought to be problematic were refilmed until the production speed, rhythm, timing, etc. was considered acceptable. After filming and editing, video clips for the individual sentences were used in the creation of the online experiment. Stimuli were presented on a desktop computer with a 19-inch computer screen (resolution 1024×768) using DMDX software (Forster & Forster, 2003). This setting was used in all but two cases. For two participants, the task was run on a MacBook Pro running Windows XP; the laptop was elevated to approximate the height of the PC used to collect the data for the other participants, and two buttons on opposite sides of the keyboard marked with red and green stickers acted as the response buttons. 4.3 Pilot phase Once the creation of the task was completed, a pilot session was run with three deaf native BSL signers. Participants in this pilot phase were instructed to focus on detecting errors in the structure of the stimuli, including non-manual marking, sign order and/or the use of space. All three signers responded to each of the 168 items, rejecting those that were not clear examples of either grammatical or ungrammatical sentences. The small number of rejected stimuli, together with a few stimuli in which agreement between all three native signers could not be reached, were removed. This resulted in a remaining set of 156 items. The revised task contained 120 stimuli, with the same overall balance of syntactic structures (specifically, 36 stimuli judged to be acceptable by the native signer panel were randomly selected for removal in order to maintain equal numbers of each sentence type as in the original 168 item task). 4.4 Participants We recruited deaf signers with varying reported ages of acquisition of BSL: 10 native signers from deaf families who were exposed to BSL from birth and 20 non-native signers from hearing families who reported being first exposed to BSL between 2 and 18years of age. Participants were for the most part clearly prelingually deaf (23 reported being deaf from birth; four reported becoming deaf before age 3, and three reported becoming deaf between ages 3 and 5). All participants reported severe or profound hearing loss. All participants reported that they use BSL every day as their preferred language and that they had been using BSL for 10years or more at the time of testing. For the purposes of analysis, we separated participants into three groups: native signers (AoA from birth), early learners (AoA in early childhood between 2 and 8years of age) and late learners (AoA after early childhood between 9 and 18years of age), following similar age groupings from Mayberry (1993). Participants who reported their age of BSL acquisition as ‘from birth’ had at least one deaf parent whose preferred language was BSL. The early learner participants reported using BSL and/or Signed English/Sign Supported English in primary and secondary school with students outside of class, and some reported using BSL or Signed English/Sign Supported English in class as well. Primary school in the UK begins at age 5, so participants in the early learner group would have been exposed to some form of signing around that age. The late learner participants reported using Signed English/Sign Supported English and/or spoken English in class, with teachers, and outside of class in primary and secondary school; three late learners reported using BSL outside of class with other students in addition to signed/spoken English. 11 Parental and educational details are not available for one early learner and one late learner. 11 Details about each group are shown in Table 2 . Note that the higher reading ages in the late learners compared to the early learners suggest a higher level of English proficiency in the late learners, and that there may be some individuals in this group of signers with English as an L1. Rather than determining participants’ first language based solely on self-reported age of BSL acquisition, we obtained objective measures of English proficiency via standardised reading tests. We also obtained objective measures for nonverbal IQ. By factoring out reading age and nonverbal IQ, we were able to examine the unique effect of age of BSL acquisition on BSL syntactic knowledge. 4.5 Procedure Participants were tested individually by a deaf native or fluent signer of BSL (and in two cases by a hearing signer fluent in BSL); in all cases, test-specific instructions were presented in BSL on video by a deaf native signer. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. As explained above, we also administered English reading test(s) as a measure of English proficiency, in addition to the BSL Grammaticality Judgement Task. We additionally administered the nonverbal subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence as an independent measure of visual–spatial skills, in order to avoid non-linguistic cognitive skills as a further confound. 4.5.1 Test of visual–spatial skills Each participant was tested first on their visual–spatial skills, using the nonverbal matrix reasoning and block design subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) (Wechsler, 1999). Based on the raw scores for these two subtests, t-scores for each subtest and an overall Performance IQ score were computed. Because subjects’ scores on the two subtests were not highly correlated (r(28)=.25, one-tailed p =.091), we kept the t-scores separate for analyses. 4.5.2 Reading test(s) Next, each participant was tested on their English reading skills. All participants were first given the General Reading Test-II (MacMillan Test Unit, 2000). Those who performed at ceiling on the GRT-II were additionally given the more difficult Vernon-Warden test (Vernon-Warden Reading Comprehension Test Revised, 1996). Reading age was determined based on the Vernon-Warden test if they took it; otherwise reading age was based on the GRT-II. 4.5.3 BSL Grammaticality Judgement Task The procedure was explained to the participants, followed by a practice session of eight sentences, including four grammatical sentences and their four ungrammatical counterparts. In the actual experiment, the 120 sentences were presented in four blocks of 30 sentences each and were individually randomised. There was a pause between blocks, with participants continuing the experiment whenever they felt ready. Stimuli were presented in the centre of the screen with a black frame surrounding (video dimensions 720×576). Participants were instructed to judge whether the sentence appeared to them to be acceptable or not by paying attention to features such as sign order and the match or mismatch of head movement and facial expressions. They were also told to respond quickly but carefully. (See Appendix A for an English translation of the full set of instructions given to participants.) Participants pressed the right button on a button-box to indicate a positive response (i.e., an acceptable sentence), and the left button to indicate a negative response (i.e., an unacceptable sentence). This mapping was changed accordingly for left-handed participants (i.e., left button for a positive response, right button for a negative response). Reaction times (RTs) were measured from stimulus onset. Each video was presented until the participants made a response, with 1000ms after response before the next trial began. 5 Results We began by examining average performance by participants and items to identify any anomalies before proceeding further. One native signer’s performance was highly atypical (accuracy more than four standard deviations lower than the mean of the other native signers) and was therefore excluded from the analyses reported here. After excluding this participant from the analysis, we averaged over subjects to determine whether any items should be excluded. We used a relatively strict criterion, excluding any item for which average performance was less than 66% correct (p(Accuracy>chance)>.05 by binomial test with n =30). This resulted in the exclusion of 23 sentences (5 grammatical, 18 ungrammatical), leaving 97 in the set for analysis (55 grammatical, 42 ungrammatical). This reduced data set was used for all analyses reported below. Hierarchical mixed effects regression analyses were conducted on trial-level data, fitting random intercepts for subjects and items, using restricted maximum likelihood estimation (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008). Separate models were fit for the two dependent measures: accuracy (proportion correct) and response time (considering correct responses only). For both dependent variables, we began by considering the main effects and interactions involving grammaticality (two levels: grammatical and ungrammatical), sentence type (six levels: simple, agreeing, negation, wh-question, relative clause, classifier construction), and AoA group considered categorically (three levels: native, early, and late). Subsequent analyses considered AoA as a continuous measure. Analyses also took into account video duration, as well as factors varying between participants which could affect performance on the task, including nonverbal IQ, reading age, and mean years of BSL experience (reading age and mean years of BSL experience were significantly different for the early and late signers we tested; see Table 2 and §5.1 below). For all continous predictors we first fit a model including nonlinear transformations (restricted cubic splines using three knots at quantiles .1, .5., .9), then removing all non-significant nonlinear terms from the final model. We report p-values estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (n =5000). 5.1 Accuracy In the initial regression model (including the full factorial contrast between grammaticality, sentence type and AoA group), none of the interactions involving AoA group approached significance (pMCMC >.2). We therefore removed the categorical variable of AoA group, instead treating AoA as a continuous measure and fitting a model without interactions involving AoA. As the effects related to item characteristics appear to dissociate from effects related to participant characteristics, we will discuss them separately. 5.1.1 Effects of grammaticality and sentence type The main effect of grammaticality was significant, with an advantage for grammatical over ungrammatical sentences (95% highest posterior density interval (HPDI) of the difference=[.002,.175], pMCMC =.049). There was also an overall effect of sentence type: responses to classifier construction sentences were the most accurate (p(correct)=.902; significantly better than all other sentence types in pairwise comparisons, with the exception of agreeing sentences for which pMCMC =.080), and responses to negation and relative clause sentences were relatively less accurate overall (p(correct)=.854 and .847 respectively). These main effects were qualified by an interaction, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Simple main effect tests on grammaticality within each sentence type revealed that this interaction was largely driven by agreeing and classifier construction sentences for which the advantage for grammatical sentences was not observed (agreeing sentences: 95% HPDI of the grammatical–ungrammatical difference=[−.194,.041], pMCMC =.152; classifier construction sentences=[−.004,.221], pMCMC =.050). All other sentence types exhibited a strong advantage for grammatical sentences (pMCMC <.006). Video duration did not predict accuracy (pMCMC =.414). 5.1.2 Effects of participant characteristics We investigated the partial effects of AoA, nonverbal IQ (separate measures for matrix reasoning and block design subtests), reading age, and mean years of BSL experience (i.e., identifying the extent to which variance is explained by each of these variables after controlling the others, as well as the item characteristics described in the previous section). Neither of the nonverbal IQ measures predicted accuracy (both pMCMC >.5), nor did reading age (pMCMC >.5) or years of BSL experience (pMCMC =.137). However there was a reliable effect of AoA (linear component pMCMC =.001, nonlinear component pMCMC =.004) as illustrated in Fig. 2 . This effect of AoA can be characterised as high performance for native signers, with reliable linear tendency for decreasing performance with AoA until approximately age 8, beyond which change in performance as a function of AoA becomes less reliable. In order to account for the AoA effects in early but not late learners, we additionally analysed the relationship between age of BSL acquisition and reading age. T-tests revealed that the mean reading age for late learners (mean=13.4years) was significantly higher than the mean reading age for early learners (mean=10.7years; t(18)=2.01, one-tailed p =0.030). Furthermore, for late learners, there was a significant zero-order correlation between English reading age and age of BSL acquisition (r(9)=.642, p =0.031), while no such correlation was present for early learners (r(11)=−.139, n.s.). 5.2 Response times The same steps for analyses were carried out on response time data, but considering only correct responses (87.0% of trials in the reduced data set). Response times were measured from the start of each video clip, and varying durations between items were controlled by taking video length (number of frames) into account in this analysis. We began with the same type of model as in the analysis of accuracy - that is, including the three-way interaction involving grammaticality, sentence type and AoA group, along with the other predictors: nonverbal IQ, reading age, and mean years of BSL experience. As was the case for accuracy data, there were no significant interactions involving AoA group (pMCMC >.25), so we proceeded to fit models including only the interaction between grammaticality and sentence type, and a separate continuous measure of AoA. 5.2.1 Effects of grammaticality and sentence type The first main effect to mention is a strong and reliable effect of video duration; participants responded slower as a function of the number of frames, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 4 below (95% HPDI on the relative increase in RT per video frame=[32ms,37.6ms], pMCMC <.0001), highlighting the need to take this factor into account in analysis of response times. The main effect of grammaticality on response times was not significant (95% HPDI=[−96ms,393ms]), although there was a reliable effect of sentence type. Responses to wh-questions and negated sentences were reliably faster than other sentence types (mean RT for wh-questions=4507ms, and for negation=4766ms; comparisons with other sentence types yielded pMCMC <.02 with the exception of agreeing sentences which were only marginally slower than these two sentence types). Simple sentences were reliably slower than all other sentence types (pMCMC <.01), except for those involving classifier constructions (pMCMC =.21). These main effects were qualified by a significant interaction, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . Tests of simple main effects revealed that there was a grammaticality effect for relative clause sentences, with grammatical sentences yielding significantly faster responses than ungrammatical sentences (95% HPDI for the difference=[203,706], pMCMC =.002). Although no other simple effects of grammaticality reached significance in isolation (pMCMC >.3 for each of the simple main effects), agreeing sentences exhibited different performance when compared to other sentence types (e.g., pMCMC =.03 in simple 2×2 interaction involving only agreeing and negated sentences, with similar patterns in other simple interactions): a relative tendency for grammatical sentences to be slower than ungrammatical sentences. 5.2.2 Effects of participant characteristics Having taken item characteristics into account, we turn to investigations of how participant characteristics predict response times, looking at partial effects of factors that vary between individuals. As was the case for accuracy, neither measure of nonverbal IQ was a significant predictor (both pMCMC >.2), nor was years of BSL experience (pMCMC =.7). The partial effect of reading age was significant (linear component only); participants with a higher reading age made faster responses, as shown in the middle panel of Fig. 4 (95% HPDI for the decrease in RT per year of reading age=[14ms,106ms], pMCMC =.007); although the results from analysis of accuracy demonstrate that this increased speed did not translate into more accurate performance. Crucially, the main effect of AoA also predicted response times (linear component, pMCMC =.025; nonlinear component pMCMC =.005) as illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 4. Here the effect of AoA was largely limited to later learners of BSL: AoA does not explain variation in RT among signers who learned BSL before about age 8 but does explain some of the variation in RT with later AoA beyond that point. To summarise, regression analyses showed age of BSL acquisition to contribute unique variance in BSL syntactic knowledge in early learners when the effects of English ability (via reading) and nonverbal IQ were controlled. No such effect of age of BSL acquisition was found in late learners (after the age of 8years). Furthermore, late learners were significantly better readers and had slower reaction times than early learners. Duration of the video stimuli predicted reaction time but not accuracy. 6 Discussion In this study, native signers were more accurate than early learners in identifying grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in the BSL Grammaticality Judgement Task. Among non-native signers, regression analyses showed that early learners (those who acquired BSL between 2 and 8years of age) showed a decrease in accuracy as age of first exposure to BSL increased, while late learners (with age of acquisition between 9 and 18years old) did not show these effects, once measures of nonverbal IQ and English reading scores were taken into account (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Furthermore, age of BSL acquisition was significantly correlated to reading age for the late learners only. Thus, the better readers were those who learnt BSL latest. Furthermore, as a group, the late learners were better readers than the early learners (i.e., the late learners scored significantly higher on the reading tests than the early learners). 12 It should be noted that the reading skills of the native signers varied considerably; this is consistent with what has been reported in the literature (e.g., Chamberlain & Mayberry, 2000; Goldin-Meadow & Mayberry, 2001). The important point here is that the native signers all had a clear L1 – BSL. Thus we focus on the reading skills of the early and late learners. 12 Taken togther, these findings suggest that the late learners in the current study may have had first language competence in English and learned BSL as a second language. That is, they can be considered L2 signers of BSL. 13 This is not to deny that the early learners did not have some degree of proficiency in English, since as noted above, all signers are bilingual to some degree. 13 This study provides two important findings. Firstly, we have provided the first unequivocal evidence of L1 age of acquisition effects in a sign language. Even when factoring out the possible confounds of reading age and nonverbal IQ, we still find a significant drop in BSL grammaticality judgement as a function of age of BSL acquisition. Specifically, performance on the grammaticality judgement task (corrected for reading age and nonverbal IQ) steadily decreases until around age 8 in the early learner group. This holds true even though the syntactic violations in the ungrammatical stimuli are quite major (e.g., moving a modal into the subject or object noun phrase). This supports, and importantly strengthens, previous research which has found L1 sign language acquisition effects in signers who self-report as delayed L1 signers of a sign language (Boudreault & Mayberry, 2006; Mayberry, 1993). Secondly, we have provided further support that delayed L1 acquisition differs from L2 acquisition of sign language. The results extend Mayberry’s (1993) findings of differences between prelingually deaf L1 signers and postlingually deaf L2 signers in an ASL sentence recall task. The fact that the current study has found differences in performance on the BSL Grammaticality Judgement Task in prelingually deaf L1 signers and prelingually deaf L2 signers has important implications. 14 As noted in §4.4, participants were for the most part prelingually deaf (though four participants did report becoming deaf between ages 3 and 5). 14 For instance, although success with literacy and spoken language amongst deaf individuals is highly variable, late learners in this study appear to have been successful in establishing English as their first language (L1). This L1 proficiency in English then may be used to scaffold learning of BSL later in life. This would explain why performance decreased as age of acquisition increased in the early learners (with AoA up to around 8years of age) but no such effect was found in late learners who acquired BSL after that. It is important to note, however, that although the reading ages of the late learners in this study were significantly higher than those of the early learners, all groups scored substantially lower than even the minimum ‘adult’ level norms for the Vernon-Warden test, reflecting the lower level of reading skills in the deaf community (Vernon-Warden Reading Comprehension Test Revised, 1996). The fact that higher reading age across all groups correlated with faster reaction times could be a reflection of more successful experience with educational testing in school. Another important implication of this study relates to the notion of a critical period for second language acquisition. Johnson and Newport (1989) proposed two versions of the critical period hypothesis: the exercise version and the maturational state version. The exercise version predicts that if the language learning capacity is exercised in early childhood via exposure to a first language, it will remain intact. If however, this capacity is not exercised during this time, it will disappear with maturation. On the other hand, the maturational state hypothesis states that maturation negatively affects acquisition of any language; that is, native-like acquisition of any language whether it is the first, second, third, etc. must begin early in life, since the human capacity for learning languages declines with maturation. Both versions make the same predictions about first language acquisition (i.e., that first language learners will not achieve native proficiency) but differ in their predictions about second language acquisition. The exercise version of the critical period hypothesis predicts that late first language learners will inevitably arrive at levels lower than native proficiency, while late second language learners will not necessarily do so, but may well reach fully native-like levels in their L2. The maturational state version predicts that anyone first exposed to an L2 after a critical period will only achieve non-native levels of skill. In the current study, no significant differences in BSL grammaticality judegement were found between the native signers and the prelingually deaf L2 signers, which is consistent with the exercise version of the critical period hypothesis. This is also consistent with studies which have found that high levels of proficiency can be achieved in second language learners (e.g., Birdsong, 1992; Bongaerts, 1999; Hakuta et al., 2003; White & Genesee, 1996). The slower reaction times of the late learners compared to the early learners is also consistent with other second language learning research; White and Genesee (1996) and McDonald (2000) found slower reaction times with late L2 learners than native or near-native speakers of English. The fact that there were no significant differences between native signers and prelingually deaf L2 signers in the current study additionally means that the BSL Grammaticality Judgement Task is not suitable for use as a screening tool for BSL skill in deaf adult signers of BSL. Such a screening tool would need to show robust and strong effects across all three groups of signers. 6.1 Variation in performance across sentence types Detailed analyses investigating analysis of variance amongst various factors in the BSL data revealed findings similar to those of Boudreault and Mayberry (2006). For example, overall there were more errors in judging ungrammatical sentences than grammatical sentences. This may simply reflect a general response bias against judging a sentence to be ungrammatical (however, this was not true for all sentence types as there was no such bias for grammaticality for classifier construction sentences and agreeing verb sentences, as discussed below). Also, relative clause structures were judged least accurately overall, in both languages. This is consistent with assumptions about relative clauses being learned relatively late in ASL acquisition, similarly to conditionals (Reilly et al., 1990). Another similarity is that in both the ASL study and the current study, the classifier construction sentences were amongst the most accurately judged of all the sentence types. Based on studies which have found that classifier constructions are mastered by deaf children very late in ASL acquisition (Schick, 1987; Supalla, 1982), Boudreault and Mayberry (2006) had predicted that classifier sentences would be amongst the least accurately judged sentence types. The assumption made by Boudreault and Mayberry actually appears to be incorrect, because studies such as Schick (1987) and Supalla (1982) have focused primarily on the acquisition of the meaningful elements of classifier constructions themselves rather than the syntax of sentences containing classifier constructions. The classifier constructions themselves (in the current study and the ASL study) were not ungrammatical. Rather, the constituent ordering in the sentences containing the classifier constructions were made ungrammatical by changing the ordering of the figure, ground and classifier construction. The typical ordering (and the order that was used in the grammatical sentences) is ground-figure-action (i.e., noun phrase representing the ground argument followed by noun phrase representing the figure argument followed by verb phrase containing a classifier construction). The ordering that was used in the ungrammatical versions was action-figure-ground. The order ground-figure-action has also been found in gesture strings produced by hearing non-signers asked to describe motion events without speech; Gershkoff-Stowe and Goldin-Meadow (2002) use this to argue for ground-figure-action (in their terminology, stationary object-moving object-action, or SMA) as a ‘natural’ order for semantic relations. Additionally, Gershkoff-Stowe and Goldin-Meadow (2002) found that gesture strings where the action was produced first occurred very rarely. If a ground-figure-action order is a ‘natural’ or unmarked order for semantic relations to be expressed in signed languages, and an action-first order is very marked, as Gershkoff-Stowe and Goldin-Meadow argue for gesture without speech, then this could explain the relatively high accuracy of classifier sentences (both grammatical and ungrammatical) compared to the other sentence types, since the classifier sentences were made ungrammatical by moving the action to the sentence-initial position. Other findings in the current study with sentence types also require some interpretation. For instance, for agreeing sentences only, ungrammatical sentences were judged more accurately and faster than grammatical sentences. Thus the ungrammatical agreeing sentences appear to be relatively “easy” to identify. This may be due to the particularly overt use of space in the ungrammatical agreeing sentences compared to the other sentence types. These sentences were made ungrammatical by moving the verb into the subject argument noun phrase. The model who produced the sentences usually accompanied his spatial modification of the agreeing verb with an overt turn of his torso toward the location established for the argument(s). This interruption of the subject noun phrase by a rotation in torso was quite overt and noticeable. For example , in example (4b) from §4.1.3 above, the model begins by signing sign with his torso facing the camera, then rotates his torso to the right for reject-3 then back toward the camera for class. In other ungrammatical agreeing sentences, for example those with double agreement verbs, the rotation is even more extreme. It is likely for this reason that the ungrammatical sentences were judged faster and more accurately than the other sentence types. The opposite pattern was found with relative clause sentences. That is, for relative clause sentences, ungrammatical sentences were far less accurately judged, and judged far more slowly, than grammatical sentences. Thus in this condition, ungrammatical sentences were “difficult”. This could be explained partly by the way relative clauses are marked in BSL (via brow raise on the subject phrase and a pause before the verb phrase) and also by the way in which the relative clauses were made ungrammatical (i.e., by swapping the positions of the subject noun phrase and verb phrase). This is different from most of the other sentence types in which sentences were made ungrammatical by moving a single sign into the subject argument noun phrase. In the ungrammatical sentences, although they may be pragmatically odd, the subject phrase and the verb phrase could each be considered clauses on their own. The fact that a pause interrupts them may make it more likely for signers to try to interpret them as separate clauses. This would explain why these ungrammatical relative clause sentences were both more slowly and less accurately judged than the grammatical sentences. 6.2 Limitations and future work In terms of studying critical period effects, one potential limitation of the current study is the inclusion of late learners with good English skills, who potentially had L1 proficiency in English. As noted in §3, recruitment of deaf individuals who reported learning BSL as a first language during or after late childhood was extremely difficult. If it had been possible to recruit only signers who reported learning BSL as a first language natively or in early/late childhood, this would have been one way to test L1 critical period effects more directly. There are several ways in which the current study could be improved upon in future, particularly in an attempt to create a screening test of grammaticality judgement. One possibility would be to probe types of ungrammaticality other than those included in this study. Following Boudreault and Mayberry’s (2006) procedure for the ASL study, most of the BSL stimuli were made ungrammatical by moving a constituent into the noun phrase. This type of violation is quite major and would appear to be ungrammatical in many of the world’s languages. There are other ways of creating ungrammatical sentences – e.g., by swapping other types of constituents, or by moving functional elements such as negative or interrogative words/constituents to inappropriate positions in the sentence. One of the challenges faced by researchers wishing to study grammaticality judgement in BSL is the extent of variability in constituent order in BSL. In fact, Deuchar (1983) and Sutton-Spence and Woll (1999) have suggested that constituent order in BSL is so variable that it is best accounted for in terms of information structure (e.g., topic/comment, given/new information), with only weakly grammaticalised constituent order constraints. The lack of understanding of variable constituent order in BSL is related to the fact that little research has been done on BSL syntax and what has been done has been based largely on small and/or unverifiable data sets. The fact that a large, representative corpus of BSL video data now exists (Schembri, Fenlon, Rentelis, & Cormier, 2011) means that studies that examine the syntactic structure in BSL, taking into account variability due to information structure, can be undertaken in the future. Once this future work is undertaken, including additional types of ungrammatical stimuli could produce results with sufficiently strong differences across groups that they could be used in a screening test, which was one of the original goals of this study. Another potential area for improvement could be the elicitation of grammaticality judgements along a rating scale (e.g. 5-point or 7-point Likert scale) instead of a binary judgement (grammatical versus ungrammatical) (Bard, Robertson, & Sorace, 1996; Sorace & Keller, 2005). Finer grained judgements could help identify those stimulus items which are most strongly judged to be grammatical or ungrammatical. Those items with mean judgement scores at either end of the scale (e.g., in a 7-point scale, those stimuli with scores closer to 1 or 7) could therefore be most usefully included in a screening test, while those stimuli with weaker judgements, with mean scores in the middle of the scale (e.g., closer to 4) could be eliminated. 7 Conclusion In summary, the current study shows significant L1 age of acquisition effects in the grammatical judgement of deaf BSL signers, when age of acquisition is between birth and around 8years of age. No such effects were found in deaf BSL signers who acquired BSL after age 8, for whom English was likely functioning as their first language and BSL as their second. The results are consistent with Boudreault and Mayberry’s (2006) findings of L1 age of acquisition effects in prelingually deaf early learners of ASL. However, the current findings importantly strengthen Boudreault and Mayberry’s (2006) findings by showing that AoA effects are still strong even when reading age and nonverbal IQ are factored out. Thus the BSL study shows the unique effect of AoA on grammatical judgement in early learners. This is the first demonstration of a unique effect of AoA on signed language acquisition. This effect suggests that native signers have the strongest advantage in grammatical judgement. Amongst non-native signers who learn BSL before the age of 8years, the earlier the acquisition of a signed language, the better the performance. Although the findings from the current study are specific to grammatical knowledge, previous studies which have found AoA effects between native signers and early L1 learners (based on self-report) suggest that this may extend to other areas such as phonology and morphology, not only in judgement but also production (e.g., Morford et al., 2008; Newport, 1990). Further research would be needed to determine if AoA contributes a unique effect in these domains. These results are also consistent with Mayberry (1993) who found L1 age of acquisition effects in prelingually deaf early and late learners of ASL (with ASL as delayed L1) and no such effects in postlingually deaf ASL signers who had acquired spoken English naturally as an L1 before onset of hearing loss. However, the current study importantly extends Mayberry’s (1993) finding of L1 and L2 differences to prelingually deaf signers who acquired BSL late but who likely had L1 proficiency in English and therefore had acquired BSL as an L2. These late learners likely used English L1 proficiency to scaffold later BSL acquisition. This supports previous research that native-like second language acquisition is possible in some aspects of grammar (e.g., in grammaticality judgement). Despite the fact that our results may not come from a representative sample of the adult deaf signing population (e.g., we did not include early learners who had English as an L1), it might be tempting to interpret these results as support for use of English first with deaf children. Our findings do suggest that some non-native signing deaf individuals can achieve a degree of proficiency in sign language as L2 if some proficiency in a spoken/written language such as English is achieved as L1 first, although these individuals do not do as well on the BSL Grammaticality Judgement Task as native signers. However, there are real risks in relying only on successful acquisition of English as L1 for deaf children. Research in North America has clearly shown that the success rates of both spoken language acquisition and literacy in deaf children continue to be very low (as our reading age scores can attest), even despite recent advances in amplification technology such as hearing aids and cochlear implants (Blamey, 2003; Traxler, 2000). Although recent statistics on spoken/written language acquisition in deaf children specifically in the UK are lacking (Conrad, 1979 is the most recent large scale UK study), there is no evidence to suggest the situation is different in the UK than in other countries. One thing that seems very clear is that successful early acquisition of a first language is crucial, whether that language is a natural signed language such as BSL or a spoken/written language such as English. Relying on the acquisition of spoken language as L1 is risky among deaf children, and if it fails, successful acquisition of a signed language as L1 is unlikely as well, resulting in an overall delay in language development that many years of exposure to sign language does not appear to eliminate (Humphries et al., 2012). The current study supports many others showing that early exposure to accessible language is much more likely to result in successful language acquisition than later exposure. The advantages of early sign language exposure remain clear even with rapid advances in hearing aids and cochlear implants (Mayer & Leigh, 2010). Bilingual education is the best way of ensuring that deaf children have early exposure to both a signed language and a spoken/written language, which will provide the deaf child with the best chance for successful language acquisition, in either or both languages (Grosjean, 2001).

You will see a set of 120 sentences. Some of them will seem “right” to you. Some of them will have errors. For example, in some sentences you may think the signs are in the wrong order, and in some sentences you may feel that the facial expressions or head movements do not match the signs. After you see each sentence, if it seems “right” to you, push the green button; if it seems “wrong” to you, push the red button. The sentences will be presented in four blocks of 30 sentences each. After each block you can take a break. During each block, respond as quickly but as carefully as you can. Keep your hands resting on the button box at all times so you will be able to push the red or green button as fast as possible. If you are right-handed, make sure the green button is on your right; if you are left-handed, make sure the green button is on your left. You will have a set of eight practice sentences first. If you have any questions, either before or after the practice, please ask us.

Abstract Flashbacks are involuntary, emotion-laden images experienced by individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The qualities of flashbacks could under certain circumstances lead to source memory errors. Participants with PTSD wrote a trauma narrative and reported the experience of flashbacks. They were later presented with stimuli from flashback and non-flashback parts of their narrative, mixed with foils from the narrative of another participant, and judged whether they belonged to their own narrative. They also reported whether stimuli elicited a flashback during this recognition test. Overall reporting a flashback at test was associated with significantly better recognition performance. Flashbacks were occasionally reported to foil stimuli, which were then likely to be wrongly attributed to the person’s own narrative. This provides proof of concept of a cognitive mechanism that could potentially account for some cases of false trauma memories. Keywords PTSD False memory Flashbacks Trauma Imagery 1 Introduction It is generally accepted that recovered memories of trauma may or may not correspond to actual events (Geraerts et al., 2009). Therapeutic suggestion may account for some instances of false recall, but memory recovery often occurs outside therapy (Brewin, 2012), requiring alternative explanations. ‘Flashbacks’ are a symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and are often observed in patients recovering memories of traumatic events (Andrews et al., 2000; Schooler, Bendiksen, & Ambadar, 1997). They consist of a type of intense involuntary memory involving repeated reliving of the traumatic event, accompanied by marked sensory detail and emotional arousal (Brewin, 2007, 2011). High levels of sensory detail are normally associated with true rather than false recollection (Schooler, Gerhard, & Loftus, 1986; Suengas & Johnson, 1988), suggesting that flashbacks are likely to be associated with previously experienced items and events. However, if apparent recollections are in fact false, the occurrence of a flashback might lead them to be incorrectly labelled as true. This study attempted to establish proof of concept of this hypothetical cognitive mechanism for producing false recall. In previous studies flashbacks have been characterised by traumatic events being reexperienced in the present rather than the past (Brewin, Gregory, Lipton, & Burgess, 2010; Ehlers, Hackmann, & Michael, 2004). They can vary from relatively mild (there is a transient sense of the event reoccurring in the present) to extreme (the person loses all connection with their current autobiographical self and present surroundings while reexperiencing the memory). They are not typically reported in healthy participants exposed to trauma (Brewin, 2011). True memories are thought to possess on average more detail than false memories, particularly sensory details involving sights, sounds, and smells (Marche, Brainerd, & Reyna, 2010; Schooler et al., 1986; Suengas & Johnson, 1988; Vrij, 2005), and are more likely to be associated with a sense of recollection (Conway, Collins, Gathercole, & Anderson, 1996; Heaps & Nash, 2001) and emotional intensity (Heaps & Nash, 2001; Laney & Loftus, 2008). Although many of these studies could be criticised for confounding the truth or falsity of memories with memory strength, the literature suggests that stimuli that elicit reports of a flashback at recall are, if true memories, more likely to be correctly labelled as such. More rarely, however, such apparent recollections may be false, in which case the occurrence of a flashback may lead to them being incorrectly labelled as true. The existence of this hypothetical effect has never, to our knowledge, been demonstrated. Individuals suffering from PTSD first wrote a detailed narrative account of their main traumatic event, and identified flashback and non-flashback sections. Single words and phrases were then extracted from the two sections of each person’s narrative and presented to them one week later. Following previous work (Barclay & Wellman, 1986), these were intermixed with foils supplied by a second individual with PTSD . The task, which combined item and source memory, was to recognise whether or not each word or phrase belonged to their own narrative. Participants reported at the end of the testing session whether each word or phrase had elicited a flashback or not. Words and phrases that elicited a flashback, either during narrative production or at recall, were expected to be rated at recall as more arousing and of greater negative valence, and to be better recognised. We also investigated whether there were any instances in which participants reported flashbacks to stimuli from another person’s narrative, and predicted that they should be more likely to incorrectly classify any such words or phrases as their own. 2 Method 2.1 Participants There were 10 participants (3men), all meeting diagnostic criteria for current PTSD when assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (First, Williams, & Spitzer, 1997). They had experienced a range of traumas, including involvement in disasters or terrorist attacks (n =3), interpersonal violence and robbery (n =4), motor vehicle accident (n =1), abduction by security services (n =1), and witnessing of mother’s dying moments (n =1). Their average age was 40.3years (SD 9.6, range 28–57years). Three were currently taking antidepressant medication. All participants gave written informed consent. 2.2 Measures The Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) (Foa, Cashman, Jaycox, & Perry, 1997) is a widely-used self-report measure. Items measuring each of the 17 PTSD symptoms are rated for the past month on a 0–3 scale. In this sample the mean PDS score was 25.30 (SD=5.85). The Beck Depression Inventory 2 (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) is a widely-used 21-item self-report measure of depression severity. It contains 21 items that are scored on a 4-point scale (possible range 0–63). Participants were instructed to rate their mood over the past week. In this sample the mean BDI score was 26.60 (SD=10.66), indicating moderate depression (Kendall, Hollon, Beck, Hammen, & Ingram, 1987). 2.3 Procedure Participants preparing to take part in an fMRI study (Whalley, Kroes, Rugg, & Brewin, submitted for publication) wrote an account of their traumatic event, starting from just before they knew something was wrong until the point where the event had resolved. Following Hellawell and Brewin (2002), flashbacks were defined for participants who then highlighted sections during the writing of which they had experienced flashbacks. Words identified by them as belonging to the flashback sections of their narrative were tabulated separately from non-flashback words and were rated for frequency (Kucera & Francis, 1967) and number of letters. Lists of 36 flashback words and 36 non-flashback words were created and matched to ‘master lists’ (see below) on word frequency and length. Phrases (typically 2–8 words long) were tabulated separately using the same procedure, and matched for length. Lists of 30 flashback and non-flashback phrases were matched to ‘master lists’ on number of letters and words per sentence. Two ‘master lists’ were generated from other participants with PTSD to provide comparable stimuli unrelated to the participant’s own traumatic event. One was from an individual who had survived the July 7th 2005 London bombings, and one from a survivor of the December 2004 Asian Tsunami. Certain words such as ‘blood’ or ‘helpless’ were common to many narratives, but words on the master list were substituted on a case-by-case basis whenever overlap was identified. During a second testing session that occurred approximately one week later stimuli from participants’ own list and one of the master lists were presented randomly on a screen at a distance of approximately 50cm while participants were being scanned. Single words were presented in the centre of the screen in uppercase 40pt, Arial font, and phrases in lowercase 30pt Arial font. The task in each case was to identify whether each word came from their narrative or from the narrative of another participant and to respond as quickly and accurately as possible using a button-box. For both tasks (task 1: words; task 2: sentences) the presentation of an item was preceded by an asterisk (*) for 500ms, followed by the item for (1000ms in task 1, 1700ms in task 2), followed by a fixation cross for 2000ms. These sequences of events gave stimulus onset asynchronies for tasks 1 and 2 of 3500ms, and 4200ms respectively. At the end of this session participants were shown a list of the stimuli and were asked to identify which, if any, items had led to them having flashbacks during the task. Participants were then given lists of all the stimuli they had seen during the test and were asked to rate each item on separate 7-point Likert scales measuring valence (scale anchored with [1] Unpleasant and [7] Pleasant) and arousal (scale anchored with [1] Low arousal and [7] High arousal). 3 Results 3.1 Reliability and validity of flashback judgments As shown in Table 1 , experiencing a flashback during the recognition test was reported to approximately half the stimuli which had elicited a flashback during production of the participant’s own narrative (Own Flashback items) and to a quarter of stimuli that had not done so (Own Non-flashback items). Experiencing a flashback to items from the control PTSD narrative (Other Flashback and Other Non-flashback items) was rare. We tested the reliability of flashback judgements with a 2 (Content: Words vs. Phrases)×4 (Narrative Section: Own Flashback, Own Non-flashback, Other Flashback, Other Non-flashback) ANOVA on the percentage of flashbacks endorsed during the recognition test. After Greenhouse-Geisser correction for departure from sphericity there were significant effects of Content (F(1, 9)=6.54, p <.05, partial eta squared=.42), Narrative Section (F(3, 27)=21.97, p <.001, partial eta squared=.71), and the Content x Narrative Section interaction (F(3, 27)=6.54, p <.01, partial eta squared=.42). A follow-up 1-way ANOVA showed that, collapsing across words and phrases, the numbers of flashbacks in all sections differed from each other significantly (Own Flashback 15.65, Own Non-flashback 9.00, Other Flashback 1.40, Other Non-flashback .50; p <.05). Follow-up t-tests showed that Own Flashback phrases led to a higher percentage of flashbacks than Own Flashback Words, t(9)=3.13, p <.02, whereas Other Flashback words led to more flashbacks than Other Flashback phrases, t(9)=3.69, p <.01. There were no differences between Own Non-flashback words and phrases, or between Other Non-flashback words and phrases, largest t(9)=1.86, p >.05. As the data were not normally distributed the analyses were repeated using nonparametric Friedman and Wilcoxon tests for related samples, which yielded similar findings. The validity of the flashback judgements was tested by examining ratings of valence and arousal. A 2×4 ANOVA on valence ratings showed a main effect of Narrative Section (after Greenhouse-Geisser correction F(3, 18)=7.61, p <.02, partial eta squared .56) but no effect of Content (F(1, 6)=2.36, p >.10), and no Content x Narrative Section interaction (F(3, 18)=1.95, p >.10). Collapsing across Content, Own Flashback words and phrases (Mean=1.94) were rated as more negative (p <.05) than all other sections (Own Non-flashback 3.25, Other Flashback 3.79, Other Non-flashback 4.00). Ratings of arousal demonstrated an identical pattern, with a main effect of Narrative Section (after Greenhouse-Geisser correction F(3, 18)=13.23, p <.01, partial eta squared .69) but no effect of Content (F(1, 6)<1) and no Content x Narrative Section interaction (F(3, 18)=1.29, p >.10). Collapsing across Content, Own Flashback words and phrases (Mean=5.91) were rated as more arousing (p <.05) than all other sections (Own Non-flashback 4.56, Other Flashback 3.40, Other Non-flashback 3.08). 3.2 Association of flashbacks with recognition A similar analysis was conducted on recognition accuracy scores (hit/correct rejection rate). Accuracy rates were too high to enable a separate test of misses. This showed no effect of Narrative Section (F(3, 27)=1.16, p >.05), and no Narrative Section×Content interaction (F(3, 27)=1.34, p >.05), but a main effect of Content (F(1, 9)=80.64, p <.001, partial eta squared .90). Phrases (mean hit rate .89) were recognised significantly more accurately than single words (mean hit rate .75). A further ANOVA conducted on Own stimuli only tested whether Content, Narrative Section, and the occurrence of a flashback during test predicted accuracy. The results indicated that reporting a flashback during the recognition test (F(1, 8)=13.52, p <.01, partial eta squared .63) was associated with better recognition performance. There were no main effects or 2-way interactions involving Content or having had a flashback during the original narrative, largest F(1, 8)=2.64, p >.05. The 3-way interaction was significant (F(1, 8)=11.90, p <.01, partial eta squared .60). Recognition was highest for phrases that had elicited a flashback both in the original narrative and at recall (mean hit rate .96), and was lowest for single words that had not elicited a flashback either in the original narrative or at recall (mean hit rate .69). The main question concerned whether participants ever reported a flashback on presentation of a stimulus from the control PTSD narrative and, if so, what was the effect on recognition judgements. Seven participants reported one or more examples of this response, which occurred an average of 3.80 times (median 2, range 1–16, SD 5.14) during the course of the experiment. In this group the mean accuracy of these responses was compared with their mean accuracy when stimuli from the control narrative did not elicit a flashback. A paired t-test indicated that mean accuracy when a flashback was experienced (.29) was very low, with the stimuli being incorrectly judged as their own, compared to when a flashback was not experienced (.81). This difference was large in magnitude and highly significant, t(6)=4.56, p =.004, d =1.72. Removal of the single outlier who reported 16 examples of this response did not change the results. 4 Discussion In this investigation flashback judgments showed moderate levels of reliability, clearly indicating the probabilistic nature of flashback elicitation by verbal cues. Consistent with previous research (Hellawell & Brewin, 2002; 2004), they also had valid external referents in the form of valence and arousal ratings, suggesting that participants with PTSD can meaningfully discriminate the occurrence of a flashback. Memory accuracy was not consistently better for stimuli that had elicited a flashback report during narrative production, a finding which may have been due to a lack of statistical power. However, consistent with autobiographical memory research suggesting that true memories are characterised by greater emotion and greater sensory detail, reporting a flashback at test was associated with significantly greater recognition accuracy. At present it is not clear whether higher accuracy can be accounted for by greater arousal, greater negative valence, greater reliving, or some other characteristic. Previous research on flashbulb memories has confirmed that recall for even highly emotional events can be inaccurate (Neisser & Harsch, 1992; Schmolck, Buffalo, & Squire, 2000). Emotional stimuli, relative to neutral stimuli, appear to produce a stronger sense of recollection even when they are not objectively remembered more accurately (Sharot, Delgado, & Phelps, 2004). In hypnosis research, the credibility of a suggested past-life experience was predicted by the subjective intensity of that experience (Spanos, Menary, Gabora, DuBreuil, & Dewhirst, 1991). We extended these findings by demonstrating that on those rare occasions when foil items were associated with a powerful involuntary trauma image, the items were very likely to be misclassified. The effect size obtained was equivalent to the foil items being 8.5 times more likely to be classified as from the participants’ own narrative in the presence of a flashback than in its absence. These data provide the first proof of concept of a potential mechanism for explaining some occurrences of false recovered trauma memories in clinical samples. Although foil stimuli were selected for being thematically unrelated to the participant’s traumatic event, it is conceivable that they did in fact have some association with information in the underlying memory representation. Similarly, it has been argued that in the clinic false memories do not arise de novo but may be based in part on memories of real events (Mollon, 1998). Thus in many cases false memories may be better conceived of as substantially false (but partially correct) memories. Among the limitations of the study is that the effect of presenting large numbers of personally-relevant cues in proximity to one another is unknown. Had presentation been interspersed with a greater amount of unrelated material, so that stimuli from the participant’s own narrative occurred more rarely, or had presentation not taken place inside a brain scanner, rates of reported flashback elicitation may have been very different. Replication is required using larger samples, different types of stimuli (including events rather than just words), and different types of eliciting context. The data do, however, add to our extremely limited knowledge concerning flashback reports and may provide a platform for better theorizing in the future. They also, more tentatively, add to existing research suggesting cognitive mechanisms that may sometimes mislead individuals recovering traumatic memories into wrongly classifying imaginary events as being part of their personal history (Brewin, 2012; Geraerts et al., 2009; Loftus & Davis, 2006).

Abstract Structural priming paradigms have been influential in shaping theories of adult sentence processing and theories of syntactic development. However, until recently there have been few attempts to provide an integrated account that explains both adult and developmental data. The aim of the present paper was to begin the process of integration by taking a developmental approach to structural priming. Using a dialog comprehension-to-production paradigm, we primed participants (3–4year olds, 5–6year olds and adults) with double object datives (Wendy gave Bob a dog) and prepositional datives (Wendy gave a dog to Bob). Half the participants heard the same verb in prime and target (e.g. gave–gave) and half heard a different verb (e.g. sent–gave). The results revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of priming across development. First, there was a small but significant abstract structural priming effect across all age groups, but this effect was larger in younger children than in older children and adults. Second, adding verb overlap between prime and target prompted a large, significant increase in the priming effect in adults (a lexical boost), a small, marginally significant increase in the older children and no increase in the youngest children. The results support the idea that abstract syntactic knowledge can develop independently of verb-specific frames. They also support the idea that different mechanisms may be needed to explain abstract structural priming and lexical priming, as predicted by the implicit learning account (Bock, K., & Griffin, Z. M. (2000). The persistence of structural priming: Transient activation or implicit learning? Journal of Experimental Psychology – General, 129(2), 177–192). Finally, the results illustrate the value of an integrative developmental approach to both theories of adult sentence processing and theories of syntax acquisition.

However, until recently there have been few attempts to provide integrated theories that explain both adult and developmental data. The aim of the present paper was to begin this process of integration by investigating how structural priming changes across development. We addressed three central questions: (1) How do priming effects differ in children and adults; (2) What can these differences tell us about how children learn and represent syntactic structure, and (3) Do accounts of adult processing make predictions that can explain both the developmental and the adult data? In structural priming studies, participants are presented with a prime sentence and then asked to produce a target sentence. Participants who are primed show a significant tendency to re-use the structure of the sentence they have just heard, even when prime and target share no lexical items (Bock, 1986). For example, participants primed with a double object dative such as the boy gave the girl some cake are more likely to produce, subsequently, a double object dative (e.g. John sent Mary a parcel) than a prepositional dative (John sent a parcel to Mary). In other words, people tend to repeat the basic structure of a sentence that they have either just heard (Bock, Dell, Chang, & Onishi, 2007) or just produced (Bock, 1986). This effect is unintentional, and has been demonstrated in speech production (Bock, 1986), written language production (Branigan, Pickering, & Cleland, 1999) and in dialog (Branigan, Pickering, & Cleland, 2000). This structural priming effect cannot be attributed solely to overlap in open or closed class words (Pickering & Branigan, 1998), to prosodic or semantic similarities between prime and target (Bock & Loebell, 1990; Bock, Loebell, & Morey, 1992), or to the repetition of information structure (Hartsuiker & Westenberg, 2000). The broad consensus is that priming occurs in sentence production because adults build, and thus represent, sentence structure independently of lexical content (Bock & Loebell, 1990). However, the presence of lexical overlap between prime and target boosts the size of the priming effect (a phenomenon known as the lexical boost), showing that these abstract representations are linked in some way to lexical representations (Pickering & Branigan, 1998). Work on priming in the adult processing literature has focused on the syntactic processes underlying the priming effect. Two theories have been proposed to explain why priming occurs. The first theory, the residual activation model (Cleland & Pickering, 2003; Pickering & Branigan, 1998) proposes that priming results from the short-term activation of the lemma nodes that represent verbs and syntactic structures in the mental lexicon. The second theory, the implicit learning theory, argues that priming is a consequence of implicit learning: a “dynamic vestige of the process of learning to perform language” (Bock & Griffin, 2000, p. 189). This theory has recently been implemented in a connectionist model of sentence production and language acquisition, which learns syntactic structure via an error-driven implicit learning mechanism (Chang, 2002, 2009; Chang, Dell, & Bock, 2006; Chang, Dell, Bock, & Griffin, 2000; Chang, Janciauskas, & Fitz, 2012). Recent work in this literature has largely focused on distinguishing between these theories by testing their predictions about the origin of the structural priming effect and the lexical boost. In the residual activation model, both the lexical boost and structural priming effects result from the residual activation of nodes and links between nodes in the lemma stratum of the mental lexicon. In the implicit learning model, structural and lexical priming effects are attributed to two separate mechanisms (see Chang et al., 2006). Unlike adult studies, priming studies with children have not focused on the origin of the priming effect but on what priming can tell us about children’s syntactic representations. In particular, studies have attempted to establish the age at which children show structural priming effects, in order to test the predictions of lexicalist and early abstraction accounts of acquisition. Lexicalist accounts propose that children’s syntactic knowledge begins in the form of lexically-dependent generalizations bound to specific lexical items such as verbs (Goldberg, 2006; Ninio, 1999, 2006; Tomasello, 1992, 2000, 2003), pronouns (Childers & Tomasello, 2001) or frequently attested arguments (Pine, Lieven, & Rowland, 1998). Children’s knowledge during the early stages of acquisition is said to be dominated by these lexically-dependent representations, which become abstract (i.e. lexically-independent) as children develop. Under early abstraction accounts, however, children are said to have categories above the level of the lexical item (i.e. abstract categories) from the beginning (Fisher, 2001; Naigles, 2002; Pinker, 1989). The precise nature of the earliest representations varies from theory to theory, but, crucially, children’s knowledge of syntactic relations does not go through a lexically-dependent stage of development. 1 For example, Pinker (1989) proposes that children work with both abstract syntactic and abstract semantic roles from the start, as well as possessing innate linking rules governing how to map one onto the other. Fisher (2001), however, proposes a less comprehensive inventory of abilities – pre-syntactic structural cues to meaning that allow children to make simple structure-meaning mappings – but these are, nonetheless, tied to abstract participant roles, not lexical items. 1 In order to distinguish between lexicalist and early abstraction accounts, researchers have focused on establishing whether young children pass through a stage in which they only show priming when prime and target share lexical items (e.g. verbs or pronouns) before developing the abstract categories required for lexically-independent (abstract) priming (Bencini & Valian, 2008; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, & Shimpi, 2004; Messenger, Branigan, & McLean, 2011; Messenger, Branigan, McLean, & Sorace, 2012; Savage, Lieven, Theakston, & Tomasello, 2003; Shimpi, Gamez, Huttenlocher, & Vasilyeva, 2007; Thothathiri & Snedeker, 2008). In summary, structural priming paradigms have played an important role both in research on sentence processing and in research on syntactic development. However, until recently these two fields have discussed the issues in isolation from each other. At the moment, none of the approaches to syntactic development takes much account of the effects reported in the adult priming literature or the theories proposed to explain these effects (though see Thothathiri and Snedeker (2008) for a preliminary attempt to consider how they might be integrated). Similarly, theories of priming in adults do not incorporate an explanation of how the adult system develops (although the implicit learning account provides an outline of a theory; see Chang et al., 2006). Since the end-product of development is the adult state, it seems to us that integrating developmental and adult-state processing theories would provide important constraints on both. Theories of adult processing would be required to explain how the systems they propose develop, while developmental theories would have to consider what processing mechanisms might be involved in the creation of syntactic representations. 1.1 The present study The aim of the present study was to inform both literatures by testing priming effects across development. We took two of the most robust findings in the adult literature – the abstract structural priming effect and the lexical boost – and tracked them throughout development, comparing the performance of 3–4year old children, 5–6year old children and adults in a structural priming task. To achieve this, we established three objectives. The first objective was to investigate whether abstract lexically-independent priming effects (where prime and target share no open class items) were present at all three ages tested, and whether the size of this priming effect changed across development. We were particularly interested in testing whether the priming effect was larger in younger children than older children and adults, because this might imply developmental differences in the strength or number of syntactic representations. It is fairly well established that less skilled speakers show larger priming effects either because they know fewer structures, so there is less competition between structures to convey meaning (Hartsuiker & Kolk, 1998; Pickering & Branigan, 1999), or because they have only weakly represented structures, which are more susceptible to change (Chang et al., 2006; Ferreira, 2003; Jaeger & Snider, 2007). These effects have been demonstrated in studies with adult aphasics (Hartsuiker & Kolk, 1998), children with specific language impairment (Leonard et al., 2000) and second language learners (Flett, 2006). However, the data from typically developing children are less clear-cut. Many existing studies report large priming effects in children (between 12% and 33% for 3-year-olds; Bencini & Valian, 2008; Shimpi et al., 2007), which are much higher than the typical 4–10% effect reported in adult studies (Chang et al., 2006). However, these differences may be due to substantial differences in methodology. For example, unlike adult studies, studies with children tend to present multiple prime sentences (Savage et al., 2003; Thothathiri & Snedeker, 2008), use slightly different coding schemes (e.g. Bencini & Valian’s (2008) ‘lax’ coding scheme), or use a between-participants or a blocked design, thus reinforcing the use of one particular structure throughout the study or block (Bencini & Valian, 2008; Savage et al., 2003; Shimpi et al., 2007). These differences make it impossible to compare the size of the priming effect in children and adults directly. In the first two studies to apply the same methodology and scoring criteria with 3-year-old children and adults, Messenger and colleagues reported no significant differences across age groups (Messenger et al., 2011, 2012). However, an inspection of their data shows some evidence for slightly larger priming effects in children than in adults, at least when utterances coded as ‘Other’ are excluded (Tables 1 and 4 in Messenger et al. (2012), Table 1 in Messenger et al. (2011)). In addition, Messenger et al. (2011) reported that children produced a greater proportion of passives than adults, which “may reflect a greater susceptibility to priming in children” (Messenger et al., 2011, p. 272). Thus, the first objective of the current study was to make cross-age comparisons of the size of the priming effect in order to assess whether priming effects are larger in younger children than older children and adults. The second objective was to compare the size of the priming effect in the presence and in the absence of verb overlap between the prime and target. A robust finding in the adult literature is that the size of the priming effect is greater when there is lexical overlap between prime and target, especially when prime and target share a verb. The additional priming that results when prime and target share a verb is called the lexical boost (Pickering & Branigan, 1998). We assessed priming both with and without verb overlap in our study in order to establish whether the lexical boost is present in children as well as adults and to assess whether the size of the lexical boost changes with development. This has implications for our understanding of whether children and adults differ in how they represent verbs, syntactic structure and the links between them. In particular, verb-based lexicalist accounts predict that young children should show a large lexical boost because their syntactic representations are tied to verbs or predicate-based constructions (e.g. giver–give–thing given -to- givee; Goldberg, 2006; Ninio, 1999, 2006; Tomasello, 2003). The development of abstract (lexically-independent) representations occurs as the child develops more and more verb-specific patterns with experience of the language, until she eventually generalizes across them on the basis of commonalities in form and meaning. Thus, verb-based lexicalist theories predict that very young children (2years or younger) will not initially demonstrate verb-independent abstract priming because they possess only verb-based representations (see Savage et al., 2003). More importantly for the present study, such theories predict that there will be substantial additional priming when prime and target share a verb (a large lexical boost) in children, even in older children who have already abstracted a verb-general pattern. This is because both verb-based representations and abstract representations are available to be primed when prime and target share a verb, making priming more likely. Under early abstraction accounts, however, children are said to have categories above the level of the lexical item (i.e. abstract categories) from the beginning (e.g. Fisher, 2001; Naigles, 2002; Pinker, 1989). On this model, since children’s representations are never more lexically-dependent than those of adults, we might expect a similar sized lexical boost across development. Previous work has not provided conclusive evidence about the presence of abstract and lexically-dependent priming in young children. On the one hand, Savage et al. (2003) found that 4-year-olds were only primed to produce passive sentences when there was lexical overlap in the pronouns and grammatical markers between the prime and target sentences. Lexically independent abstract priming (i.e. priming in the absence of lexical overlap) only appeared from 6years of age. On the other hand, Bencini and Valian (2008) reported that 3-year-olds showed significant priming effects even when prime and target shared no open class lexical items. Similarly, Thothathiri and Snedeker (2008) have reported comparable levels of priming in 3-year-olds whether or not the prime and target sentences shared a verb, although the priming effect was slightly (but not significantly) larger when prime and target shared a verb. The second objective of the present study was, then, to test whether young children show a larger priming effect when prime and target share a verb (i.e. a large lexical boost), as predicted by verb-based lexicalist accounts. The third objective was to attempt to integrate development and adult processing literatures in order to derive developmental predictions from two sentence processing theories; the residual activation model and the implicit learning theory. Our aim is not to draw strong conclusions about the theories themselves, but simply to explore possible developmental predictions. We acknowledge that some of the authors of the theories may disagree with our attempts at integration. However, the process of establishing what needs to be explained and of exploring possible solutions derived from the current literature may nevertheless prove informative. The residual activation model (Cleland & Pickering, 2003; Pickering & Branigan, 1998) is not a developmental model. However, because of the way it conceptualizes syntactic representations, it seems to be potentially compatible with either early abstraction or lexicalist theories of development. Within the activation model, the priming effect results from the activation of lexical entries within the lemma stratum of the mental lexicon (Levelt, 1989; Roelofs, 1992, 1993). The lemma stratum contains a network of lemma nodes corresponding to verbs (e.g. give), which are connected to combinatorial nodes that represent the verbs’ syntactic properties and specify the syntactic structures in which they can occur (e.g. double object dative). During production or comprehension of the prime sentence (e.g. give in a double object dative), the verb (give) node, and the relevant (double object) combinatorial node are both activated and the link between them is strengthened. Afterwards, the nodes and the links between them maintain a level of residual activation for a short period of time. As a result, when the participant then wants to produce a target sentence, the residual activation that remains in the combinatorial node makes the choice of the same structure for the target utterance more likely. The lexical boost occurs because the link between the verb lemma node and the combinatorial node is also strengthened by the presentation of the prime sentence, which makes it even more likely that this structure will be chosen for the target utterance when prime and target share a verb. If we combine the activation model with an early abstraction theory of acquisition, we must posit that both the syntactic combinatorial nodes and the verb lemma nodes are set up and available for activation early on in the acquisition process. Thus, both lexically-independent priming effects (resulting from activation of the combinatorial nodes) and the lexical boost (resulting from the additional strengthening of the link between the combinatorial and verb nodes) should be visible from an early age. If we combine the activation theory with a verb-based lexicalist theory of acquisition, we must posit that children’s knowledge of syntactic structure starts off tied to individual verbs and, thus, to particular verb lemma nodes. Therefore, we would expect stronger priming effects in children than in adults when prime and target share a verb, due to the activation of the verb-based representations shared across prime and target. In addition, the activation model, at least as it currently stands, should predict that any structural priming effect should always be accompanied by a lexical boost when prime and target share a verb, whatever the age of the participant. This is because when the prime sentence is presented, the link between the verb and combinatorial node is always strengthened. As a result, when the target contains the same verb as the prime, the strengthened link means that additional priming (the lexical boost) must occur. The link between verb lemma and combinatorial nodes is an integral part of the theory because it is required to explain why the lexical boost occurs when prime and target share a verb but not when there is overlap in tense, aspect, number or function word: The combinatorial nodes “link directly to, and only to, the lemma nodes” within the model (Pickering & Branigan, 1998, p. 695; see also Cleland & Pickering, 2003). Thus, although the model could be adapted to incorporate developmental differences (e.g. by proposing that the strengthening of the link decays more quickly or more slowly for children than adults), as it stands, it predicts that structural priming effects will always be accompanied by a lexical boost when prime and target share a verb. Unlike the residual activation model, the implicit learning theory has already integrated developmental and adult processing predictions in a connectionist model (Chang et al., 2006). The model is made up of two pathways: one that learns syntactic constraints and one that learns how to activate meaning elements (Dual-path architecture). In this model, structural priming is a consequence of the same error-driven implicit learning process that drives syntactic development. Learning occurs when the model attempts to predict the next word at each point in a sentence. Any mismatch between the next word and the target word (called error) is used to adjust the model’s internal representations. In other words, the child model learns syntactic structure by gradually adjusting its internal representations so that it can correctly predict heard sentences. Structural priming occurs because this implicit error-based learning process stays ON in the adult model. Experiencing a prime sentence causes adjustments in the model’s internal representations that slightly bias it to produce a similar structure when it is required to produce a target sentence to express a particular message, creating structural priming. These priming effects can be seen from the age-equivalent of 3years (age-related developmental stages are attributed to the model by comparing its linguistic behavior to that of children of different ages: Fig. 24 in Chang et al. (2006)). Thus, in common with other developmental theories, the model predicts that lexically-independent (abstract) priming effects will be present in children as young as 3years of age. Unlike the activation model, the Dual-path model does not use a single mechanism to explain both structural priming and the lexical boost. Only structural priming is said to result from the implicit learning mechanism. Lexical boost effects are attributed to a different underlying mechanism, partly because these effects are large and highly variable compared to abstract structural priming effects, which tend to be smaller and less variable. For example, unless one posits a learning mechanism that is highly sensitive to task differences, it is difficult to see how the same learning mechanism could capture both the 73% priming effect reported in Hartsuiker, Bernolet, Schoonbaert, Speybroeck, and Vanderelst’s (2008) Experiment 1 and the 45% effect reported in their Experiment 2 (in both experiments the verb was shared between prime and target). In fact, it would be very difficult to implement this type of variable learning mechanism in a connectionist network such as the Dual-path model, because large weight changes would be needed to model such large effects. Large weight changes are problematic in connectionist implementations because they tend to lead to catastrophic interference, where previously learned knowledge is destroyed by recently experienced input (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989). For these reasons, Chang and colleagues (Chang et al., 2006, 2012) argued that the lexical boost must be due to a different mechanism from the implicit learning mechanism involved in long-term structural priming. In concert with the work suggesting that memory is composed of multiple memory systems (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993; James, 1890), Bock and Griffin (2000) and Chang et al. (2006) suggest that the lexical boost should be attributed to short-term activation of explicit memory traces. On this dual mechanism account, the presence of the same verb in the target as in the prime sentence would act as a retrieval cue, enabling speakers to base their target response on a memory trace of the structure of the prime sentence. In support of this idea, Hartsuiker et al. (2008) reported that, unlike abstract structural priming effects, lexical boost effects dissipated quickly, which made their time course similar to short term lexical-semantic priming effects (Levelt et al., 1991). Importantly for the present paper, if explicit awareness of repetition is the basis of the lexical boost, we might expect the lexical boost to develop with age. This is because children’s ability to form, store and retrieve memory traces across a range of tasks increases with age (for reviews, see Kail, 1990; Schneider & Pressley, 1997). For example, Dempster (1981) and Gathercole, Pickering, Ambridge, and Wearing (2004) have documented robust developmental differences in children’s performance in working memory tasks (e.g. digit span, word span and letter span) across the childhood years (from 2years to adulthood). In a different domain, Thomas and Nelson (2001) have reported that 10-year olds are better able than 4- and 7-year olds to recall the sequence of events in an object tracking task, and Coyle and Bjorklund (1997) have reported that children’s performance in sort recall tasks (that require children to explicitly recall lists of words) increased from 8 to 10years. In other words, because adults and older children have a much greater chance of recognizing and recalling lexical information than children, if the lexical boost has a strong lexical memory component, we would predict that it would also increase with development. Thus, the final aim of the present study was to test whether the lexical boost develops with age. To conclude, the present study investigated the development of syntactic structures by comparing structural priming effects in young children (3–4years), older children (5–6years) and adults. We investigated whether children and adults could be primed to produce double object and prepositional dative sentences in a dialog priming task both (a) when prime and target shared a verb (same verb condition; e.g. give–give) and (b) when the prime modelled a different verb to the target (different verb condition: e.g. send–give). We assessed the size of the priming effect across development to establish whether structural priming effects are bigger in children than adults, and we tested whether the size of the lexical boost was greater in children than adults, as predicted by verb-based lexicalist theories of development, or a similar size across development, as predicted by early abstraction accounts. We also tested whether structural priming effects are always accompanied by a lexical boost when prime and target share a verb, as predicted by the activation model, and whether the lexical boost increases with development, as predicted by the dual mechanism (implicit learning) account. In order to ensure we could make comparisons across ages, we designed a study that mimicked many of the design strengths of adult priming studies but that could be administered in the same format to children and adults. The design was adapted from Branigan et al.’s (2000) confederate scripting method. In common with many adult priming studies, we specified (a) that there should only be one prime sentence per target utterance; (b) that each prime–target utterance-pair should be followed by fillers; (c) that all participants should be primed with both structures (within-participants design); and (d) that a range of verbs and different sentences should be used. 2 Method 2.1 Participants Participants were sixty-three 3- and 4-year-olds (mean age 3;8, range 3;1 to 4;10), forty-eight 5–6year olds (mean age 5;11 range 5;5 to 6;4) and 57 adults. A further five 3–4year olds and twelve 5–6year olds were recruited but were excluded due to experimenter error (10) or because they produced fewer than five target responses (7). All participants were monolingual British English speakers with no identified language delay or disorder. The children were recruited from local nurseries and schools and were tested in their nurseries/schools or in the laboratory at the University of Manchester. Adults were undergraduate students at the University of Liverpool, recruited through an experiment participation scheme, who received course credits for taking part. They were tested in the language development laboratory at the University of Liverpool. 2.2 Design and materials We used a 3×2×2 mixed design with two between-participants variables: Age (3–4year olds/5–6year olds/adults), and Verb match (same verb/different verb in prime and target), and with one within-participants variable: Prime type (double object dative [DOD] or prepositional dative [PD]). 2 Testing both Verb match and Prime type as within-participants variables would have meant testing each participant with 48 test items and fillers. We judged that this would make the testing sessions too long for the 3–4 year olds, so opted to manipulate Verb match as a between-participants variable. 2 Participants were randomly allocated to the same or different verb condition and one of two counterbalance groups. 2.2.1 Sentence stimuli We chose six dative alternating verbs familiar to young children in both prepositional and double object structures – give, show, send, pass, 3 Pass is common in British English and is used in the same contexts in which US parents use the verb hand. 3 throw, bring. Verbs were included either because they were documented in both structures in corpora of speech to UK children (e.g. in the Manchester corpus; Theakston, Lieven, Pine, & Rowland, 2001) or because published studies have reported that they are produced by young children or their parents (Campbell & Tomasello, 2001; Gropen, Pinker, Hollander, Goldberg, & Wilson, 1989; Snyder & Stromswold, 1997). Forty-eight sentences were created by pairing each verb with four different sets of characters in PD (24 sentences) and DOD (24 sentences) structures. This gave eight different possible sentences per verb (see Table 1 ). Each verb was presented four times per participant: twice in the prime sentence (once as a PD and once as a DOD) and twice in the target sentence (preceded once by a PD prime and once by a DOD prime). No participant heard or was asked to produce the same sentence twice. Sentences were always modelled in the past tense (gave, showed, sent, passed, threw, brought). Overall, each participant was presented with 12 prime–target pairs, interspersed with 12 filler–filler pairs, divided into two sessions. There were also eight practice items that consisted of non-causal actions described with intransitive sentences (e.g. Piglet and Tigger were waving; Wendy pointed at Bob and the fish; see Appendix A). The stimuli were designed so as to remove all overlap except that provided by the verb (in the same verb condition) and the preposition (to). In order to avoid lexical overlap and stress-pattern/syllable-length overlap in the noun phrase, primes that contained determiner noun phrases (e.g. the princess) were always followed by targets with proper noun phrases (Bob) and vice versa. In order to minimize phonological overlap between the prime and target sentences (except for the verb in the same verb condition), verbs were presented in simple past-tense form, to minimize overlap in the use of morphemes such as present progressive -ing or 3rd singular –s. The presentation of the prime–target pairs was counterbalanced to control for verb/sentence-specific preferences. Each sentence always occurred in both DOD and PD primes (across counterbalance groups). The use of both proper noun and determiner noun phrases also ensured that the results were not influenced by a preference for DOD structures with proper noun recipients or for PD structures with determiner noun phrase recipients. The order in which the sentences were presented in the counterbalance conditions was semi-random, except for the constraint that all 6 verbs occurred once in session 1 (in one structure) and then again in session 2 (in the other structure). This enabled us to present each verb in both PD and DOD structures, but minimized verb–verb priming across prime–target pairs. Each prime–target pair was separated by a filler–filler pair to minimize priming effects between pairs (see Appendix A). 2.2.2 Visual stimuli The visual stimuli were cartoon movies, created in Anime Studio Pro. Each cartoon contained three characters who were familiar to young British children and who played out transfer actions. There were six pairs of donor and recipient characters. Three had proper noun names: Tigger and Piglet, Dora [the Explorer] and Boots, Bob [the Builder] and Wendy. Three pairs were referred to with determiner noun phrases: The prince and the princess, The king and the queen, The boy and the girl. To make it easier for children to formulate the target utterances, donor and recipient characters were always paired in a familiar manner (e.g. Tigger and Piglet). Five characters acted as objects: a baby, a cat, a fish, a puppy, and a rabbit. All characters were animate in order to ensure that priming effects were not enhanced by animacy contrasts between object and recipient roles (Bock et al., 1992). However, all objects were plausibly capable of being received by the recipient. We created 24 cartoons depicting the six different transfer actions (giving, showing, sending, passing, throwing, bringing). We also created 24 filler cartoons and 8 practice items, all depicting non-causal actions (e.g. Bob and Wendy waving). Each prime picture was always paired with a target picture that depicted different characters. We also controlled for whether the action unrolled from right-to-left or from left-to right in prime–target pairs. The movies were presented in E-Prime 2 on a laptop computer. The experiment was run as a Bingo game, so Bingo cards were created that depicted pictures that corresponded to half of the experimental item and filler videos. We also created Bingo grids – pieces of card divided into 6 squares. 2.3 Procedure The study took the form of a Bingo game. The experimenter and participant took it in turns to describe videos on the laptop screen to the confederate. The experimenter produced the prime sentence and the participant produced the target sentence. After each sentence, the confederate looked to see if she had the Bingo card corresponding to that sentence. If so, she gave the card to the experimenter or participant as appropriate. The first to fill up their bingo grid (all 6 squares) with cards won the game. 4 The game was rigged so the participant always won, but not until all the prime-target pairs had been completed. 4 Like Pickering and Branigan (1998), we used a stem completion technique to ensure that the target sentence contained the target verb, even when the prime had contained a different verb. The experimenter modelled the subject and verb of the target sentence and the participant then had to complete the sentence to describe the video. For example, the experimenter might say “the king gave…” and the participant had to produce either “the queen a dog” or “a dog to the queen”. Use of the stem completion technique meant that the vast majority of responses, even from the youngest children, were PO or DO datives. Each prime–target pair was followed by a filler–filler pair. Here the experimenter and participant took turns to describe videos depicting non-causal events (e.g. Bob was flying). In total, each participant took part in two sessions (separated by a 2–10min break). Each session contained 24 items; 12 described by the experimenter (6 of which were primes and 6 fillers) and 12 described by the participant (6 targets and 6 fillers). Session 1 was preceded by 8 practice items – 4 for the experimenter and 4 for the participant – to familiarize participants with the task. 2.4 Coding During the experiment, the experimenter recorded the participant’s response automatically using the response coding function of E-Prime 2. The experiment was also audio or videotaped and the participant responses were checked by the first author. 5 20% of the 5–6 year olds’ data was not recorded due to a fault, so these responses are based on one coder only. 5 The rate of agreement between coders (calculated over 10% of the data) was 97%. Most discrepancies were easily resolved by listening to the tapes. Where discrepancies could not be resolved, the response was coded as a non-target response and excluded from the analysis. In 0.7% of cases, the experimenter did not model the prime correctly (e.g. used the wrong dative or the wrong verb; 1.3% for 3–4year olds, 0.5% for 5–6year olds and 0.3% for adults). These cases were excluded. The participants’ responses were then coded as Prepositional dative, Double object dative or Non-target responses. Double object datives were responses in which the participant produced the post-verbal phrase in the order Recipient-Theme (Piglet brought … Tigger the cat). Prepositional datives were responses in which the participant produced the post-verbal phrase in the order Theme-to-Recipient (Piglet brought … the cat to Tigger). This was a strict definition of the Prepositional dative and excluded responses with an omitted preposition (Piglet brought … the cat Tigger), responses with for (Piglet brought … the cat for Tigger) and responses with at (Piglet threw … the cat at Tigger). 6 Although prime and target share a general syntactic frame here, the participants’ failure to model the preposition of the prime mean that the amount of lexical overlap differed. Since we are explicitly testing the effect of lexical overlap, we decided to code these as Non-target responses. In practice, there were very few such responses (2% of all responses for the 3–4 year olds, 0.35% for the 5–6 year olds and 1.32% for the adults). 6 Responses in which the participant used the wrong noun (e.g. queen instead of princess) were rare but were included as target responses. Participants almost never used pronouns. For 22% of the 3–4year olds’ responses, the experimenter had to prompt the child to complete the sentence. This only occurred in the prepositional dative condition, for example: E: Piglet threw... C: the cat (pause) E: to... C: Tigger. These were coded as prepositional datives, although we also re-ran the analyses without them and obtained the same pattern of results. Non-target responses included responses in which the participant did not produce either a to-prepositional dative or a double object dative (e.g. Piglet passed … Tigger and the cat) and responses in which the participant used the wrong verb. There were very few of these responses – 5% for 3–4year olds, 0.7% for 5–6year olds and 2% for adults. All Non-target responses were excluded from all analyses (both descriptive and inferential statistical calculations). The dependent variable for the descriptive statistics was calculated as the proportion of dative responses that were double object datives (the dispreferred structure). The inferential statistics were conducted on the raw data. 3 Results The aim of the study was to investigate whether we could find structural priming effects in a comprehension-to-production priming task with young children (3–4years), older children (5–6years) and adults. We tested both lexically-independent structural priming (different verb condition) and lexically-dependent priming (when prime and target share a verb: same verb condition). Fig. 1 shows the mean proportion of datives produced that were double object datives both after a DOD prime (i.e. match between prime structure and target response) and after a PD prime (i.e. mismatch between prime structure and target response; see Appendix B for the mean number of different responses produced by condition). The results were analyzed with logistic mixed effect models, which are well suited to analyzing binary dependent measures like structure choice (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008; Jaeger, 2008). They are similar to logistic regression but allow us to model both random subject and item effects together. 7 We also ran the more traditional by-items and by-subjects ANOVAs on empirical logit transformed scores. All ANOVAs gave the same results as the logistic models. 7 In the first model we analyzed the full dataset. The model included as fixed effects (a) Verb match condition (same/different verb), (b) Age group (3–4years/5–6years/adult) and (c) Prime type (DOD, PD). Age was centered to reduce multi-collinearity (Neter, Wasserman, & Kutner, 1985) and other factors were effect/sum coded (Wendorf, 2004). Both participant and item (verb) were included as random effects. 8 Similar results were found when maximal models with random slopes and intercepts for both subjects and items were tested for each of the analyses. Each model was tested by building a maximal model and removing the highest order slope terms that accounted for the lowest amount of variance until the model converged. Analysis of variance confirmed that none of the models with random slopes were significantly different from the random intercept models, so we have chosen to report the simpler model only. 8 The model revealed a main effect of Prime type; β =0.86 (SE=0.13), z =6.82, p <.001, indicating that the participants were significantly more likely to produce a double object dative after a double object dative prime (and thus conversely more likely to produce a prepositional dative after a prepositional dative prime). There was also a main effect of age group; β =0.11 (SE=0.02), z =5.51, p <.001, indicating that, overall, double object dative production increased with age. There was an interaction of Prime type and Age group; β =0.05 (SE=0.02), z =2.59, p =.001, indicating that overall, the size of the priming effect increased with age. There was an interaction of Prime type and Verb match condition, β =1.02 (SE=0.25), z =4.06, p <.001, because priming effects were larger when prime and target shared a verb (lexical boost). However, these effects must be considered in the light of a significant three-way interaction between Verb match condition, Prime type and Age group; β =0.13 (SE=0.04), z =3.65, p <.001, which suggests that the magnitude of the lexical boost varied across the different age groups. 3.1 Analyses by age Separate logistic mixed effect models were run at each age to investigate the interactions. At 3–4years there was a significant main effect of Prime type only, β =0.72 (SE=0.26), z =2.74, p =.006, with no effect of Verb match condition and no interaction. In other words, the 3–4year olds produced more double object datives after double object dative primes than prepositional dative primes and did so to the same extent in both the same verb (23.5% vs. 16.8%) and different verb (21.4% vs. 14.6%) conditions – there was no lexical boost. At 5–6years, there was a main effect of Prime type; β =0.59 (SE=0.22), z =2.66, p =.008, and a marginal interaction between Prime type and Verb match condition; β =0.77 (SE=0.44), z =1.73, p =.08. Thus, the 5–6year olds also produced more double object datives after double object dative primes than prepositional dative primes in both the same verb (28.7% vs. 15.6%) and different verb (28.9% vs. 25.9%) conditions, but here the effect was marginally larger for the same verb condition (i.e. there was a small lexical boost). For the adults, there were both main effects of Prime type and Verb match condition (both ps<0.05) and a significant interaction between Prime type and Verb match condition; β =2.12 (SE=0.38), z =5.64, p <.001. Thus, although there was, once again, an overall priming effect, the adults, unlike the children, showed significantly more priming in the same verb condition (55.4% vs. 18.9%) than in the different verb condition (51.2% vs. 47.7%) – a large lexical boost. In summary, all three age groups showed a lexically-independent (different verb) structural priming effect of between 3% (adults and 5–6year olds) and 7% (3–4year olds). However, no lexical boost was evident in the data from the 3–4year olds (the size of the priming effect for both same and different verb conditions was 7%). There was some evidence of a slightly larger lexical boost in the data from the 5–6year olds (priming effect of 13% in the same verb condition, 3% in the different verb condition, so a 10% lexical boost) but this difference was only marginally significant (p =.08). It was only the adults who showed a substantial and significant lexical boost (priming effect of 37% in the same verb condition but only 3% in the different verb condition, so a 34% lexical boost). 3.2 Analyses by verb condition Separate logistic mixed effects models were run for each verb condition to investigate how the size of the priming effect changed across development. We also calculated Cohen’s d, which provide an effect size measure of the magnitude of priming that factors out variability across different groups of participants (Cohen, 1992). It was important to control for participant variability because there were large differences in the baseline preferences for the two datives across ages. The children, in particular the 3–4year olds, used fewer double object datives overall than the adults; each 3–4year old produced only two double object datives on average, whereas the adults produced an average of five each. This means that similar sized priming effects between adults and children may hide very different sized proportional increases. 9 For example, a priming effect of 5% that represented an increase in DODs from 5% to 10% would constitute a 100% proportional increase in the number of DODs produced (i.e. priming would effectively double the number of DODs produced). A priming effect of 5% that represented an increase in DODs from 50% to 55% constitutes only a 10% increase. 9 Table 2 reports the size of the priming effect for each age group and verb match condition, calculated first as the difference in the proportion of DODs produced in each prime condition (difference score) and then as Cohen’s d for repeated measures samples (Dunlap, Cortina, Vaslow, & Burke, 1996). The results of the logistic mixed effect model indicated that, in the same verb condition, there was a significant effect of Age, β =0.08 (SE=0.03), z =3.12, p =.01, and Prime type, β =1.35 (SE=0.18), z =7.66, p <.001, and importantly an interaction between Age and Prime type, β =0.11 (SE=0.03), z =4.29, p <.001. In other words, the size of the priming effect in the same verb condition increased significantly across development. Priming effects were significantly larger for adults than for 3–4year olds (37% for adults vs. 7% for 3–4year olds; β =0.12 (SE=0.03), z =4.18, p <.001, and 5–6year olds (13% for 5–6year olds; β =0.09 (SE=0.03), z =2.91, p =.004), although there was no significant difference between the two groups of children, β =0.51 (SE=0.46), z =1.12, p =.27. Cohen’s d confirmed that the size of the priming effect was substantially greater in adults than children. Cohen’s d was small for 3–4year olds (0.26), medium for 5–6year olds (0.52) and large for the adults (1.47). 10 Cohen’s d is considered small (greater than 0.2), medium (greater than 0.5) or large (greater than 0.8). 10 In the different verb condition, the results of the logistic mixed effect model indicated a significant effect of Age, β =0.13 (SE=0.03), z =4.58, p <.001, and Prime type, β =0.36 (SE=0.18), z =1.97, p =.05, but no interaction between Age and Prime type, β =-0.02 (SE=0.03), z =-0.77, p =.44. In other words, the size of the priming effect did not differ significantly across age groups (3–4year olds=7%, 5–6year olds=3%, adults=3%). However, the magnitude of the effect size expressed as Cohen’s d did seem to indicate that the 3–4year olds were primed more than the other two groups, with an effect size of 0.28 compared to the very small effect for the 5–6year olds (0.12) and the adults (0.12). In other words, there was some indication that the least skilled speakers (the 3–4year olds) showed larger priming effects when we controlled for participant variability and sample size. 3.3 Analyses excluding participants who never produced DODs Some of the participants never produced a double object dative at all. Instead, these children only produced prepositional datives. Nineteen of these were 3–4year olds, meaning that 32% of our youngest children showed no evidence of being able to produce double object datives and, thus, no evidence of priming. As a result, as a precautionary measure, we re-ran the analyses with these participants excluded. The results were very similar to those for the full sample; there was a significant three-way interaction between Verb match condition, Prime type and Age group; β =0.12 (SE=0.04), z =3.41, p =.0006, indicating that all age groups were primed and that the size of the lexical boost increased with age. Models run for each age group separately also showed similar results to the original analyses with the full sample; at 3–4years there was a main effect of Prime type only; β =0.71 (SE=0.26), z =2.72, p =.007, at 5–6years there was a main effect of Prime type; β =0.58 (SE=0.22), z =2.64, p =.008, and a marginal interaction between Prime type and Verb match condition; β =0.76 (SE=0.44), z =1.72, p =.09, and for the adults there was a significant interaction between Prime type and Verb match condition; β =2.08 (SE=0.37), z =5.55, p <.001. 3.4 Analyses by verb: 3–4 year olds We also considered the possibility that we failed to find a lexical boost in the youngest age group because these children did not know some of the verbs, or were less familiar with them than the older children and adults. It has already been established that different verbs may show different levels of resistance to priming. For example, Gries (2005) found that sentences with double object dative biased verbs like give are less likely to be affected by priming than more equi-biased verbs (see also Bernolet & Hartsuiker, 2010). Thus, it may be that knowledge of specific verb forms may interact with the lexical boost. In order to test this, we analyzed the youngest children’s data for each verb individually. We hypothesized that if the lack of the lexical boost resulted from unfamiliarity with the verb, the most frequent verbs or the earliest-learnt verbs would be those that were most likely to show a lexical boost. Give is the most frequent of the six dative verbs we tested (595 dative uses in the ICE-GB corpus) and show is the second most frequent (90 in the ICE-GB corpus). Give is also often the first dative verb that children learn (at about 2years of age), with show often appearing only a few weeks or months later (Gropen et al., 1989). It has also been suggested that give is the verb most likely to show lexical effects because it is considered to be a path-breaking verb according to some lexicalist theories (e.g. Ninio, 1999). In these theories, generalization from path-breaking verbs to other later-learnt verbs is responsible for the development of more abstract syntactic knowledge. We ran separate mixed effects logistic models on the data for the 3–4year old children for each of the six verbs individually. There were no effects of Verb match condition and no interactions between Prime type and Verb match condition for any of the verbs (all ps>.2). In other words, there was no evidence for a lexical boost for any of the verbs, even the frequent early-learnt verbs give and show. In fact, for both give and show, there were slightly, though not significantly, larger priming effects when prime and target did not share a verb. 3.5 Results summary Overall, the results showed significant differences in priming across development, from age 3–4years, through 5–6years to adulthood. Structural priming occurred in all three age groups, with evidence for a larger magnitude priming effect size (Cohen’s d) in the youngest children than in the older children and adults when prime and target sentences contained different verbs. The size of the lexical boost, however, increased across development. Only adults showed a large and significant lexical boost in the size of the priming effect when prime and target shared a verb. There was some evidence that adding verb overlap between prime and target produced a moderate (marginally significant) lexical boost in the 5–6year old group, but it had no effect on the size of the priming effect for the 3–4year old children. 4 Discussion The aim of the study was to investigate whether we could find structural priming effects in a comprehension-to-production priming task with young children (3–4years), and to compare these effects to those found with older children (5–6years) and adults. We tested developmentally (a) the size of the lexically-independent structural priming effect (different verb condition) and (b) the size of the lexical boost (when prime and target share a verb, same verb condition). Our first finding was that all age groups, including the 3–4year old children, showed evidence of abstract structural priming. There were significant main effects of structural priming both when we considered all age groups together and when we considered them separately at each age. These results suggest that 3–4year old children already have representations of dative structure that are independent of lexical items. This finding fits with other work on structural priming in children, which reports such effects in 4-year-old children (Huttenlocher et al., 2004; Kidd, 2012a, 2012b) and in 3-year-olds (Bencini & Valian, 2008; Messenger et al., 2011, 2012; Shimpi et al., 2007; Thothathiri & Snedeker, 2008). There was also some evidence in our data that the magnitude of the structural priming effect size (Cohen’s d) was greater in the youngest group then in the older children and adults in the different verb condition, although the difference did not reach significance in the mixed effect model. This finding, if confirmed, would support those of other studies that show that structural priming effects are larger in less skilled speakers (Flett, 2006; Hartsuiker & Kolk, 1998; Leonard et al., 2000) and in children (Messenger et al., 2011). This may be because less skilled speakers know fewer structures, so there is less competition between structures to convey meaning (Hartsuiker & Kolk, 1998; Pickering & Branigan, 1999). Alternatively, if priming involves error-based learning (Chang et al., 2006), it may be that it is easier to prime children than adults because their knowledge is more weakly represented: less predictable utterances yield more error and hence more weight change. For example, if the younger children’s knowledge of the double object dative was weakly represented, hearing the double object dative in the prime would produce a large priming effect precisely because it was less predicted. Older children and adults, who have stronger representations of the double object dative, would then be primed less strongly. In fact, this possibility is given support by the fact the 3–4year olds had a clear preference for the prepositional dative, which suggests that they are more familiar with that structure than with the double object dative (and see Conwell and Demuth (2007), Rowland and Noble (2011) and for other evidence that prepositional datives are easier for 3–4year olds to produce and comprehend). It is not possible for us to test this explanation directly in the present study because we do not know whether priming effects were stronger with double object dative primes than with prepositional dative primes. Future work could incorporate a baseline measure of children’s syntactic preferences in order to establish whether priming is stronger with double object dative primes. It is also worth pointing out that the size of the priming effect is smaller in our study than in other studies that have used a similar task with adults (Hartsuiker et al., 2008) and children (Messenger et al., 2011, 2012). However, it is probable that these differences can be attributed to differences in the task and stimuli used. In particular, both Hartsuiker and Messenger tested participants in a true dialog task, in which two speakers were conversing with each other, whereas in our study both speakers were describing pictures to a third party, which may produce smaller priming effects (see Branigan, Pickering, McLean, & Cleland, 2007). In addition, both Hartsuiker and Messenger asked their participants to describe still pictures, whereas our participants described dynamic videos in which the events unfolded over time, which may have introduced different response biases. Finally, Messenger primed for passives, whereas we primed for datives. It, thus, seems most likely that task differences are responsible for differences in the magnitude of the priming effect across studies. Our second finding was that there were substantial differences in the size of the priming effects across age groups when the prime and target sentences contained the same verb (same verb condition). There was no evidence that the 3–4year old children were sensitive to verb overlap in prime and target, the priming effect was the same size in both same and different verb conditions. By 5–6years, there was a small (but marginally significant) increase in the size of the priming effect in the same verb condition, and by adulthood there was a substantial and highly significant increase. Thus, the size of the additional priming provided by verb overlap – the lexical boost – increased with development. Theories of development that propose that children’s syntactic knowledge begins as verb-specific generalizations have problems explaining why we found no lexical boost in the youngest children’s data (Goldberg, 2006; Ninio, 1999, 2006; Tomasello, 2003). Even if we assume that children have already started to develop abstract representations before the age of 3years, we would still expect some evidence of the earlier-built verb-specific formulae to remain. For example, if children start to learn the double object dative by building verb-based schemas (e.g. giver –give– givee–thing given) and then generalize across such schemas to formulate an abstract double object dative construction, these early-built schemas should be available for priming, just like the abstract double object dative construction. They should thus contribute to additional priming (a lexical boost). We can see no reason within the theory why this would not be the case, since verb-specific schemas are seen as equivalent to more abstract schemas (giver –give– givee–thing given is seen as functionally equivalent to NP–V–NP–NP; Goldberg, 2006; Tomasello, 2003). One way of explaining why we find no lexical boost might be to argue that our study is not tapping into the relevant lexically specific knowledge, because this knowledge is tied to lexical items other than verbs. For example, given that most double object datives contain pronominal recipients, we might posit that children start by building dative frames around pronouns or combinations of pronouns/nouns and verbs (e.g. lexical patterns such as give him X or pass Mummy X [where X stands for a variety of NPs]). Although these frames remain available even after children have generalized across them, they will only be activated when the incoming sentence contains the same lexical material (i.e. not when the prime is Dora gave Boots the fish). Alternatively, even if they are activated, the frames may not constitute appropriate templates for the construction of the target sentence (e.g. the king gave the queen a dog) and may be unavailable for use. This might explain why other studies have found that young children show lexical boost effects when prime and target sentences share pronouns (e.g. it got caught by it primed it got broken by it; Savage et al., 2003) and nouns (van Beijsterveldt & van Hell, 2009), but why we found no effect when prime and target shared verbs. Our results are less problematic for early abstraction accounts, which propose that children have categories above the level of the lexical item from the beginning (i.e. abstract categories) and do not predict a larger lexical boost early in development. Yet, even for these theories, the lack of any lexical boost at all in the youngest children’s data is surprising given that such effects are so robust in adults. One possible explanation is provided by Thothathiri and Snedeker (2008). They also reported no significant difference between same and different verb priming for 3–4year old children tested in a comprehension priming study that tracked eye movements at critical points in the presentation of the target sentence (although the same verb priming effect was marginally greater). Thothathiri and Snedeker suggest that, although we must credit adults with both abstract and lexical knowledge in order to explain findings showing that adults represent links between individual verbs and abstract nodes (Trueswell & Kim, 1998), children might begin with abstract representations only. On this model, abstract structural representations are built first in development, perhaps on the basis of structure-meaning mapping biases (Fisher, 2001). Building the links between abstract structural nodes and particular verbs takes longer because it relies on prior exposure to the verb in that syntactic structure. These links develop verb-by-verb, as the child is exposed to more instances of correct verb use. This account would explain the lack of a lexical boost early in development – the link between the primed verbs and the syntactic structure is not yet available to provide additional priming. However, further work is required to test whether it makes accurate predictions about how the verb-structure links develop. 4.1 Testing integrated accounts of language development and language processing The final aim of the study was to test whether accounts of adult processing make predictions that can explain both the developmental and the adult data. The activation model of adult priming does not make direct predictions about the mechanism of development but it is potentially compatible with early abstraction accounts of development, which, as we have seen above, are compatible with our results. However, the activation account also predicts that structural priming will be accompanied by a lexical boost when prime and target share a verb, whatever the age of the participant. This is because the presentation of a verb in the prime sentence is said to activate the lemma node associated with that word (e.g. give) and this, then, in turn, strengthens the link with the combinatorial node associated with that verb. In other words, the link between the verb lemma and combinatorial node is always strengthened on the presentation of the prime sentence; it is just that this does not lead to additional priming when the target contains a different verb. This makes it difficult for the theory to explain how structural priming can occur without a lexical boost when prime and target share a verb in our younger children; the strengthening of the link between the nodes should always occur and thus should always cause a lexical boost. One solution might be to integrate the activation model with the early abstraction account suggested by Thothathiri and Snedeker (2008) and summarized above. Thothathiri and Snedeker suggested that children begin with abstract representations only; lexical entries are annotated for syntactic structure over a longer time frame as a result of exposure to verbs in particular syntactic structures. We could hypothesize that the (abstract) combinatorial nodes within the activation model are built first as a product of a learning mechanism that generalizes across all of the heard instances of a structure. Each of these instances will contribute to the reinforcement of the combinatorial node (e.g. every instance of a double object dative will reinforce the double object combinatorial node). However, since only those instances that contain the relevant verb will reinforce the link with that verb node, the process of annotating the verb nodes for the structures in which they can occur takes longer. This is a similar adaptation to that suggested by Coyle and Kaschak (2008), who proposed that experience with language could result in long-term changes to the strength of the links between combinatorial and verb lemma nodes within the lexicon. This adapted model could then potentially explain the lack of a lexical boost early in development by proposing that the link between the verb node and the combinatorial node is not strong enough to provide additional priming in younger children’s representations. It might also provide a direct explanation of why structural priming effects are larger in younger children than older children and adults by incorporating developmental differences in the strength of the links between verbs and combinatorial nodes. Unlike the activation model, the Dual-path (implicit learning) account already predicts a developmental dissociation between structural priming and the lexical boost (Bock & Griffin, 2000; Chang et al., 2006). On this model, multiple memory and learning systems are involved in language processing and language acquisition. Structural priming is seen as a consequence of the implicit statistical learning mechanism that is responsible for learning syntactic representations in the first place. This implicit learning mechanism was implemented in the Dual-path model of Chang et al. (2006) as a simple recurrent network (SRN, Elman, 1990) that developed abstract categories via distributional learning and a separate meaning component that learnt how to use meaning to sequence these categories to generate grammatical sentences. Both learning and structural priming occurred because the model responded to error between predicted and actual sentences by changing the weight of connections between nodes, which strengthened the network’s predictive abilities. This model can explain both why we find a small but consistent abstract priming effect across all ages, as reported in this study, and why the younger children showed a slightly larger priming effect than the adults. Young children’s syntactic representations are less strongly represented than those of older children and adults, and less strongly represented structures yield stronger priming effects because they are less predictable and result in more error (Chang et al., 2006; Ferreira & Bock, 2006; Jaeger & Snider, 2007). The implicit learning account is also compatible with the finding that the lexical boost, but not the abstract priming effect, increases with development; the lexical boost is attributed to short-term activation of explicit memory traces, which are formed, stored and retrieved more easily as children age (Chang et al., 2006). Chang et al. (2012) have since expanded on the ideas in Chang et al. (2006), proposing a complementary systems account that draws on ideas in cortical/hippocampal systems theories (McClelland, McNaughton, & O’Reilly, 1995; O’Reilly and Rudy, 2001). In these theories, long-term knowledge in cortical systems is updated through slow changing implicit learning mechanisms, while the hippocampus has a fast-changing binding mechanism that quickly links different cortical representations. The original Dual-path model can be seen as instantiating an account of the cortical language system in that it uses a slow learning mechanism, and lesions to the two pathways in the model yield deficits that mimic those with cortical lesions in Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas (Chang, 2002). Chang et al. (2012) suggest that, if we assume that the hippocampus can create fast bindings between verb semantics and structural representations, then those bindings could support the lexical boost. This complementary systems account would help to explain the rapid decay of the lexical boost (Hartsuiker et al., 2008), as the fast binding in the hippocampus can causes old verb-structure bindings to be overwritten (unlike the slow learning in the cortical language networks). It is also known that hippocampal systems can bind many different types of cortical representations (e.g. spatial cues, task context; Komorowski, Manns, & Eichenbaum, 2009) and this could help explain why the lexical boost varies in magnitude across different tasks in the adult priming literature (e.g. Hartsuiker et al., 2008, reported a 73% same-verb priming effect in Experiment 1 but only a 45% same-verb priming effect in Experiment 2). In contrast, the cortical language system is not tightly linked to the task context so abstract priming should vary less over tasks (see Kaschak, Kutta, and Coyle (2012) for some evidence that this is the case). Since the slow implicit learning is independent of the hippocampus, we would also predict that amnesiacs with impaired medial temporal/hippocampal structures should show normal structural priming, and there is evidence in support of this prediction (Ferreira, Bock, Wilson, & Cohen, 2008). Finally, the sensitivity of the hippocampal system to the task context can provide an explanation for the growth in the lexical boost over development. If young children have more trouble maintaining a constant context across prime and target trials compared with adults, then their ability to use these bindings should be diminished and that could explain why the lexical boost is absent. Since this account depends on task context, which is not specific to structural priming, we should predict similar developmental dissociations in other linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. There is some evidence for such dissociations in the literature. For example, some statistical learning studies report similar levels of learning across children and adults while others report more learning in adults than children (Saffran, 2001; Saffran, Newport, Aslin, Tunick, & Barrueco, 1997). Similarly, Thomas and Nelson (2001) found that 4-, 7- and 10-year olds showed equivalent levels of learning in an implicit object tracking task but reported that 10-year olds were better able to make explicit predictions about these sequences. In summary, although the details of the mechanism still need to be made explicit, the complementary systems account ties a working model of abstract structural priming to an account of why the lexical boost varies across tasks and increases with development, and suggests ways in which different brain regions may support these phenomena. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, the present study is the first to demonstrate that, although both children and adults can be primed to produce particular sentence structures, there are substantial differences in the magnitude of priming across development. In particular, the size of the structural priming effect seems to be slightly larger in younger children than older children and adults, but the size of the lexical boost increases substantially with development. This last finding means that in addition to the task-specific factors that seem to influence the magnitude of the lexical boost in adult studies, the effect also changes with development. The results support the idea that abstract syntactic knowledge can develop independently of verb-specific frames. They also support the idea that different mechanisms may be needed to explain lexically-dependent and lexically-independent priming. Finally, they illustrate how an integrated, developmental approach can contribute to theory building. The activation model of priming (Pickering & Branigan, 1998) can explain lexical boost effects in adults but would need to implement a developmental component to explain the lack of a lexical boost in young children. Implicit learning theories (Bock & Griffin, 2000; Chang et al., 2006) already argue for a common mechanism underlying syntactic adaptation in acquisition and adult processing, and can explain why abstract priming and the lexical boost show different developmental profiles. However, future work in this framework is required in order to implement developmental lexical boost and structural priming effects within a single model.

Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of two theoretical hypotheses about how different levels of cognitive processing are decoupled from the external environment during inattention. It is illustrated how high-level and low-level cognitive processing is coupled (below the black line, black arrows) or decoupled (above the black line) from the external environment. (a) The dichotomy-hypothesis proposes that attentional decoupling occurs in an all-or-none fashion, where cognitive processing is either coupled (left, grey) or decoupled (right, black) from external input. (b) The levels of inattention hypothesis proposes graded degrees of decoupling, including fully coupled (left, lightgrey), weakly decoupled (middle, darkgrey), and deeply decoupled (right, black) processing. Fig. 2 Sensitivities (d′) from a mixed effects signal detection analysis for different types of errors in Exp. 1 and 2. Conditions lexical and syntactic were not tested in Exp. 1 to discourage strategies other than understanding the text. Discourse was not tested in Exp. 2 to focus on levels of deep mindless reading. Conditions are color-coded, ranging from high-level errors (light grey; left) testing weak mindless reading to low-level errors (black; right) testing deep mindless reading. Error bars are SEM from a GLMM testing (sliding) differences in sensitivity between neighboring error types (Venables & Ripley, 2002). (* p <.05, ** p <.01, *** p <.001, —p >.10). Fig. 3 Influences of high-level and low-level linguistic variables on gaze durations in three reading conditions: mindless reading, a control condition, and mindful reading. Gaze durations were measured on 14 words prior to the error sentence and were residualized for random effects from the LMM; error bars are SEM. (A) High-level wrap-up effect: gaze durations on sentence- or phrase-final words versus non-final words. Data is from both experiments. (B) Low-level lexical effect: modulation of gaze durations due to word length, word frequency, and their interaction in Exp. 2. Short words are six or fewer letters long; word frequencies were median split. Fig. 4 Effects of high- and low-level linguistic variables on gaze durations during mindless (black, solid line) and mindful (grey, dashed line) reading in Exp. 1 (upper panels) and Exp. 2 (lower panels) for different intervals (N of words) prior to the error sentence. Graphs depict standardized regression coefficients from LMM analyses. For each interval, a separate LMM analysis was conducted and tested whether a given effect differed between mindless and mindful reading. For the high-level wrap-up effect (left panels), positive regression coefficients represent the standard wrap-up effect of longer fixations on final compared to non-final words. For the low-level interaction between word frequency and length (right panels), positive coefficients indicate a stronger frequency effect for long words than for short words. Fig. 5 Differential effects (mindless versus mindful reading) of high-level and low-level variables on gaze durations for different categories of errors. The graphs show how standardized regression coefficients representing the influences of high-level wrap-up (left panel) or low-level lexical (right panel; word frequency×length interaction) variables differ between trials where errors were overlooked (mindless reading) versus detected (mindful reading). Negative difference-values indicate that the influence of linguistic variables on gaze durations is reduced during mindless reading, reflecting attentional decoupling. High-level errors (light grey, dotted lines) are gibberish text and discourse errors, medium-level errors (dark grey, dashed lines) are semantic and syntactic errors, and low-level errors (black, solid lines) are lexical errors. Regression coefficients are from LMMs for different intervals of words prior to the error sentence.

Abstract When the mind wanders, attention turns away from the external environment and cognitive processing is decoupled from perceptual information. Mind wandering is usually treated as a dichotomy (dichotomy-hypothesis), and is often measured using self-reports. Here, we propose the levels of inattention hypothesis, which postulates attentional decoupling to graded degrees at different hierarchical levels of cognitive processing. To measure graded levels of attentional decoupling during reading we introduce the sustained attention to stimulus task (SAST), which is based on psychophysics of error detection. Under experimental conditions likely to induce mind wandering, we found that subjects were less likely to notice errors that required high-level processing for their detection as opposed to errors that only required low-level processing. Eye tracking revealed that before errors were overlooked influences of high- and low-level linguistic variables on eye fixations were reduced in a graded fashion, indicating episodes of mindless reading at weak and deep levels. Individual fixation durations predicted overlooking of lexical errors 5s before they occurred. Our findings support the levels of inattention hypothesis and suggest that different levels of mindless reading can be measured behaviorally in the SAST. Using eye tracking to detect mind wandering online represents a promising approach for the development of new techniques to study mind wandering and to ameliorate its negative consequences. Keywords Mind wandering Reading Eye movements Signal detection theory Levels of processing Sustained attention 1 Introduction Most people experience mental states in which they are no longer attending to the task at hand and are instead thinking about something else (Schooler et al., 2011; Smallwood & Schooler, 2006). This ubiquitous phenomenon of mind wandering, which was long ignored in the cognitive sciences, has recently received considerable attention (Christoff, Gordon, Smallwood, Smith, & Schooler, 2009; Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010; Levinson, Smallwood, & Davidson, 2012; McVay & Kane, 2010; Reichle, Reineberg, & Schooler, 2010) and is thought to be tightly related to the brain’s default mode of operation (Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, & Schacter, 2008; Mason et al., 2007). Mind wandering and task focus are typically treated as a dichotomy (Schooler et al., 2011; Smallwood, 2010b; Smallwood et al., 2011), where people are either mind wandering or focused on a given task. To investigate dichotomous aspects of mind wandering many previous studies have relied on subjective self-reports (Giambra, 1995; Smallwood & Schooler, 2006). Our main goal with the present work is to propose the levels of inattention hypothesis, which assumes that different hierarchical levels of cognitive processing are decoupled from external input in a graded fashion, reflecting states of deep and weak attentional decoupling. To measure different levels of decoupling during reading, we introduce a new paradigm, the sustained attention to stimulus task (SAST), which is based on signal detection analyses of readers’ sensitivity for errors in the text. Analyzes of a large dataset of eye movements during mindless reading support the levels of inattention hypothesis and show that eye tracking technology can be utilized to predict states of mindless reading online. The phenomenon of mind wandering involves two specific alterations in cognitive processing (Schooler et al., 2011; Smallwood & Schooler, 2006). First, during mind wandering attention is directed away from the external environment (i.e., attention lapses), which reduces cognitive processing of perceptual information (Kam et al., 2011; Smallwood, Beach, Schooler, & Handy, 2008). This process of attentional (or perceptual) decoupling can lead to failures in the performance of external tasks (Christoff et al., 2009; McVay, Kane, & Kwapil, 2009; Robertson, Manly, Andrade, Baddeley, & Yiend, 1997; Smallwood, Riby, Heim, & Davies, 2006). Second, mind wandering often involves stimulus independent thought (SIT) where attention is directed towards internal information derived from memory (Smallwood & Schooler, 2006; Stawarczyk, Majerus, Maquet, & D’Argembeau, 2011). The cognitive sciences have described the mind as consisting of a multitude of different cognitive processes (Gazzaniga, 2009). As one important principle these processes are organized at different hierarchical levels, ranging from early low-level perceptual-motor processes towards increasingly abstract representations at higher levels (Cohen, 2000; Craik & Lockhart, 1972; Gazzaniga, 2009). For reading, various models – including models of eye-movement control (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Warren, & McConnell, 2009) and theories of language processing (Graesser, Olde, & Klettke, 2002; Kintsch, 1998; Malmkjaer, 2002) – have postulated hierarchical processing at visuomotor, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse levels. How (in)attention affects different lower and higher levels of stimulus processing was long discussed in the debate about early (Broadbent, 1958) versus late (Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963; Treisman, 1960) attentional selection, and there is evidence that attentional selection can attenuate processing at early or late stages (Chun, Golomb, & Turk-Browne, 2011; Lavie, 2005). Mind wandering reduces external attention and can attenuate stimulus processing at all levels of the cognitive hierarchy (for review see Smallwood, 2011). This was demonstrated in studies investigating high-level episodic memory encoding (Riby, Smallwood, & Gunn, 2008; Smallwood, Baracaia, Lowe, & Obonsawin, 2003; Smallwood, McSpadden, & Schooler, 2008; Smallwood et al., 2006), intermediate task-relevant stimulus processing (Barron, Riby, Greer, & Smallwood, 2011; O’Connell et al., 2009; Smallwood et al., 2008), early low-level multimodal perceptual processing (Kam et al., 2011; Weissman, Roberts, Visscher, & Woldorff, 2006), and sensory input processes (Smilek, Carriere, & Cheyne, 2010b). The present work concerns how these diverse findings can be integrated into a coherent theoretical framework. The cascade model of inattention (Smallwood, 2011; Smallwood, Fishman, & Schooler, 2007) proposes a mechanism to explain decoupling in a hierarchical cognitive system. According to the model, mind wandering reduces cognitive processing of incoming information at a very early perceptual level and across multiple sensory modalities. The consequences of such low-level decoupling then “cascade downward through the cognitive system” (Smallwood et al., 2007, p. 233) and cause decoupling at higher levels. Based on this mechanism, the model parsimoniously explains why decoupling impairs performance in “as wide a range of tasks as perception, encoding and reading” (Smallwood, 2011, p. 68). Stimulus-independent thought and stimulus-dependent thought are usually treated as a dichotomy (Smallwood et al., 2011), and this view has dominated previous research (e.g., Christoff, 2012; Fox et al., 2005; Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010; Levinson et al., 2012; McVay & Kane, 2012b; Reichle et al., 2010; Smallwood, 2010b). Here, we investigate attentional decoupling and whether it is of a dichotomous or a hierarchically graded nature. First, the dichotomy-hypothesis proposes that different levels of cognitive processing are decoupled from external input in an all-or-none fashion (see Fig. 1 a): during task focus all hierarchical levels of cognitive processing are coupled to the external environment, but when the mind wanders this coupling breaks down at all levels. As a potential mechanism, attentional decoupling may always attenuate early perceptual processing stages across modalities (reflecting early attentional selection, Broadbent, 1958) and the consequences of this low-level decoupling may cascade into the system to impair analysis at higher levels (Smallwood, 2011; Smallwood et al., 2007). For the phenomenon of mindless reading, the dichotomy-hypothesis predicts that impaired visual representations of the text prevent a successful analysis at the lexical, syntactic, semantic, and the discourse level. As an extension of the dichotomous view, we propose the levels of inattention hypothesis (Fig. 1b): We postulate that cognitive processing of external input does not always fail at an early perceptual level, but fails at different hierarchical levels, resulting in different graded degrees of weak and deep attentional decoupling. During occasional episodes of deep decoupling, cognitive processing of external input ceases at an early perceptual level (early attentional selection), and the consequences of this low-level decoupling cascade into the system to cause decoupling at higher levels (Smallwood, 2011; Smallwood et al., 2007). As a new contribution, we postulate states of weak decoupling, where high-level cognitive processing is decoupled from the external environment (i.e., late attentional selection, Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963) but low-level processing is fully intact. Lastly, during states of full attentional coupling external information is processed at all levels. Combining the levels of inattention hypothesis with the cascade model of inattention (Smallwood, 2011; Smallwood et al., 2007) predicts that decoupling at different levels is hierarchical because reduced cognitive processing at one specific level will cause decoupling at higher levels in the hierarchy. Previous studies on attentional decoupling have typically focused on dichotomous aspects of the decoupling process: many studies investigated decoupling in the sustained attention to response task (SART) via failures to inhibit the response to rare target stimuli (Manly, Robertson, Galloway, & Hawkins, 1999; Robertson et al., 1997; Smallwood et al., 2004, 2006), and/or via dichotomous measures of SIT (Kam et al., 2011; Reichle et al., 2010; Smallwood et al., 2008). However, some previous studies suggest that the underlying phenomenon may not be dichotomous. A recent model (Cheyne, Solman, Carriere, & Smilek, 2009) has proposed three discrete states of task engagement/disengagement – occurrent task inattention (to dynamically changing “moment-to-moment stimulus meaning”), generic task inattention (to the “general task environment”), and response disengagement (i.e., inattention to “motor behavior”) – and found support for these states in analyses of the SART (see also Cheyne, Carriere, Solman, & Smilek, 2011; Seli, Cheyne, & Smilek, 2012). Moreover, based on principle component analyses, Smallwood and colleagues (Smallwood, 2010a; Smallwood, McSpadden, Luus, & Schooler, 2008) (also see McVay & Kane, 2012a) showed that performance errors were preceded by a gradual shift in response times from slow to fast responses, which may lend support to a graded nature of decoupling. With the present work we test theoretical hypotheses by studying attentional decoupling during reading. Mind wandering has long been thought to be elusive to vigorous scientific investigation because it is difficult to induce and control in the laboratory. For example, mindless reading was considered to “be very difficult to study experimentally” (Rayner & Fischer, 1996, p. 746). Previous research has approximated mindless reading via scanning of z-strings, where each letter in a text is replaced by the letter ‘z’ and subjects are asked to move their eyes across the z-strings ‘as if they were reading’ (Nuthmann & Engbert, 2009; Nuthmann, Engbert, & Kliegl, 2007; Rayner & Fischer, 1996; Vitu, O’Regan, Inhoff, & Topolski, 1995). Other studies have approached mindless reading by studying old readers (Wotschack & Kliegl, 2011) or via reading of randomly shuffled text, where the order of words in a text is randomly shuffled and subjects have the task to read the meaningless word lists (Schad & Engbert, 2012; Schad, Nuthmann, & Engbert, 2010). 1 Based on the levels of inattention hypothesis, we suggest that z-string scanning (Vitu, O’Regan, Inhoff, & Topolski, 1995) may be regarded as approximating a state of deep mindless reading, where no language processing is present. Shuffled text reading (i.e., reading random word lists), to the contrary, may approximate weak mindless reading, where processing of higher-level text meaning is absent, but some processing of individual words is intact (Schad & Engbert, 2012; Schad et al., 2010). 1 To catch spontaneous episodes of mind wandering during normal reading, research has focused on thought sampling methods, where subjects are asked to report about their inner experiences of mind wandering (Giambra, 1995; Reichle et al., 2010; Schooler, Reichle, & Halpern, 2004; Smallwood & Schooler, 2006). Both approaches have their limitations. Approximating mindless reading via paradigms like ‘z’-string scanning may not capture the phenomenon of mind wandering. Studying mind wandering using the thought sampling method is subject to the limitations associated with subjective self-report on cognitive processes, i.e., introspection (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977), and continuously monitoring one’s conscious thought may change behavior. As a complementary approach, indicators for mind wandering have been derived from behavioral measures of attentional decoupling. Previous behavioral approaches include failures to inhibit the response in the sustained attention to response task (SART: Bellgrove, Hawi, Gill, & Robertson, 2006; Christoff et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2007; Manly et al., 1999; Molenberghs et al., 2009; Robertson et al., 1997; Seli, Cheyne, Barton, & Smilek, 2012; Smallwood et al., 2006; Smilek, Carriere, & Cheyne, 2010a), and reaction times in a word-by-word reading paradigm (Franklin, Smallwood, & Schooler, 2011). However, there is currently a lack of objective measures that catch mind wandering in natural and complex tasks like normal reading. 1.1 Present experiment To fill this gap in current experimental approaches, we introduce the sustained attention to stimulus task (SAST), which is based on psychophysics of error detection in a reading experiment. Our analyses use recordings of eye movements to derive measures for attentional decoupling. Methodologically, we manipulated a corpus of normal text by inserting specific meaningless error sentences containing different kinds of errors. We added a control condition where error sentences contained no error. Readers were asked to indicate whenever they noticed that the text turned meaningless. Mindless reading was operationally defined as (a) overlooking an error passage (single-trial level), and (b) low sensitivity for errors (aggregated level). In this new paradigm, we utilize classical psychophysical methods from signal detection theory (Wickens, 2002) to distinguish between sensitivity for errors (i.e., the propensity for mindless reading) and a general tendency of readers to respond in a certain fashion. The approach does not require instructions about mind wandering, and may be less intrusive and more objective than self-report measures used in previous studies. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that instructions about errors may affect reading behavior as readers may pay increased attention to detect the errors in the text. To counteract such effects we (a) optimized the experimental setting to increase the chance of observing mindless reading in the eye tracker (see Methods section for details) and (b) included high-level errors such that text comprehension was necessary to detect the errors and relatively normal reading can be expected. To avoid detecting mindlessness when readers were in fact paying attention to the task several measures were taken: first, very easy texts were selected to ensure that readers would have no comprehension difficulties (cf. Smallwood et al., 2007). Second, readers received instructions and examples explaining the different error types. Third, readers were encouraged to respond also when unsure about the presence of an error. To generate measures for low-level and high-level decoupling, we constructed errors at different levels of the text (Table 1 ). (i) We replaced one word in an error sentence by a pseudo-word, causing a lexical error. If low-level lexical processing is decoupled from the text, then readers cannot detect lexical errors. Second, (ii) we included syntactic errors as a measure for syntactic processing. (iii) Statements that are incompatible with the readers’ world knowledge were included to construct semantic errors. If medium-level sentence meaning is not processed, then readers cannot detect semantic errors. (iv) We included sentences that clearly contradicted their context to construct discourse errors. These can be detected only when readers integrate the meanings from neighboring sentences into a single representation, and thus tested for high-level discourse processing. Lastly (v), we reordered nouns and pronouns from the meaningful control sentences to construct gibberish text for comparability with previous research (Smallwood et al., 2007). Readers may automatically construct meaning from meaningless gibberish text without noticing by reordering words (Ferreira, Bailey, & Ferraro, 2002), and we therefore expect gibberish text to reflect high-level construction or repair processes. All errors were constructed to (a) lack an overall meaning and (b) show no similarities to any possible meaningful sentence. For example, pseudo-words were not implemented as spelling-errors, but constructed to have no similarities to any existing word. This was done to ensure that overlooking errors would indicate mind wandering and would not occur because readers constructed meaning from meaningless text. Based on dichotomous versus graded conceptions of decoupling, we derived predictions for readers’ sensitivity for different error types. The levels of inattention hypothesis predicts that sensitivity should differ between error types: readers should be very sensitive to low-level errors (e.g., lexical errors) as these should be overlooked only during deep decoupling. To the contrary, readers should be less sensitive to errors assessing high-level text processing (discourse errors, gibberish text) because already weak decoupling prevents detection of these errors. Based on the dichotomy-hypothesis, attentional decoupling should either cause no differences in sensitivity between error types, or any differences in sensitivity should be due to different durations (rather than depths) of mind wandering. We recorded eye movements in the SAST to derive measures for different levels of cognitive text processing during reading (Rayner, 1998, 2009). Readers usually look longer at phrase- and sentence-final words compared to non-final words, and this wrap-up effect is related to the high-level process of integrating words and constructing a text meaning (Just & Carpenter, 1980; Warren, White, & Reichle, 2009). Moreover, readers look longer at low-frequency compared to high-frequency words (Inhoff & Rayner, 1986; Just & Carpenter, 1980; Rayner, 1998; Rayner & Duffy, 1986) reflecting low-level lexical processing. Reichle et al. (2010) were the first to study mind wandering during reading using eye tracking. They argued that lexical and linguistic influences on eye movements are reduced during mindless reading, indicating a decoupling of cognitive processing from the text (see also Rayner & Fischer, 1996; Rayner & Raney, 1996; Schad & Engbert, 2012; Schad et al., 2010; Rabovsky, Alvarez, Hohlfeld, & Sommer, 2008). The levels of inattention hypothesis predicts that during states of weak decoupling high-level (wrap-up) processes should be reduced, but low-level (lexical) influences should be intact. During deep decoupling, however, high- and low-level influences should be reduced. Predicting mindless reading from eye movements: A major current challenge and chance for mind wandering research is to identify objective and reliable online-markers that allow detecting episodes of mind wandering (including their onset and offset) without relying on subjective self-reports or interfering with task performance (Franklin et al., 2011; Smallwood, in press). Previous findings (Reichle et al., 2010; Smilek et al., 2010b; Uzzaman & Joordens, 2011) suggest that eye movements may be ideally suited for this purpose because they (a) provide a good measure of moment-to-moment cognitive processing and attention (Rayner, 1998, 2009), (b) occur with high frequency in virtually all tasks (Liversedge, Gilchrist, & Everling, 2011), and (c) are relatively easy to record and analyze. At the same time, it may be difficult to predict mind wandering from eye movements. First, finding that mindless reading predicts measures of eye movements [i.e., a high probability P(eye|mindless)] is not the same as finding that eye movements predict mindless reading [i.e., a high probability P(mindless|eye)], and these two probabilities can be very different. 2 For example, the probability for professors to have a high-school degree, P(high-school|professor), likely approaches one, while the probability for high-school graduates to become a professor, P(professor|high-school), is much lower. Treating these probabilities as equal reflects the fallacy of the transposed conditional (Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, & van der Maas, 2011). 2 Here, we use a Bayesian analysis to determine the posterior probability, P(mindless|eye), that a reader is currently in a state of mindless reading given a recorded eye movement. Second, when observing mean differences between mindful and mindless reading at the level of groups (averaged over participants, trials, and/or individual eye movements) it remains unclear whether mindlessness can be inferred from the eyes at the level of individual eye movements or trials. Such predictions might be difficult to derive, because eye-movement measures exhibit considerable variance (Kliegl, Nuthmann, & Engbert, 2006; Rayner, 1998). Notably, reading fixations crucially depend on the words and sentences being read. However, the design of the present study allows investigating mindless and mindful reading on exactly the same text material, including specific target words. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Participants and materials Thirty German high school students, aged between 17 and 20years, were paid 45 € each to participate in the study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision. Participants read 50 stories, taken from elementary school textbooks and slightly modified for the experiment (henceforth Potsdam Mindless Reading Corpus, PMC). The text corpus comprised about 17,500 words distributed across 216 pages of text. 2.2 Apparatus In an attempt to create a situation where participants were likely to encounter episodes of mindless reading, readers were seated in a comfortable, laid-back easy chair where they could rest their head on a headrest and their legs on a footstool. An arm mount was positioned for the recording of eye movements, holding an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research) in the remote setup and a 17-in. flat panel LCD screen. The monitor was positioned slightly above the eye level of the reader and then tilted downward, so that a reader’s line of gaze would be perpendicular to the vertical plane of the monitor. The viewing angle of the monitor and monitor tilt were occasionally adjusted to achieve maximum comfort for each reader. Viewing distance was approximately 50cm, at which each letter of text horizontally subtended approximately .37 degrees of visual angle. The eye tracker sampled left eye position at a rate of 500Hz. Readers could move their head freely, but for the most part chose to rest it on the head rest of the chair. The EyeLink remote system tracked possible head movements and corrected measured eye position for these movements. The stories were presented in black against a brown-grey background. A rectangular dark brown-grey frame was drawn around the text to create the impression of reading from a sheet of paper. Monitor brightness was reduced to the minimum. 2.3 Design and errors in the text Two experiments were conducted in succession. Each experiment required participants to read 25 stories. Sixty-two error sentences were defined at quasi-random locations in the PMC, with each story containing one or two error sentences. For each error sentence, several different versions of similar length were constructed. They contained six different kinds of linguistic errors (including an error-free control condition) and were designed to probe for five different levels of mindless reading (Table 1). Which error type was presented at a given location in the text was varied between readers. This was done within experiments 1 and 2 separately. Importantly, the design allowed us to test the effects of different levels of mindless reading and of mindful reading on the same text material. Across both experiments, errors were presented in 48 out of 62 target locations per participant, resulting in a relatively low average presentation rate of one error per 354 words (equivalent to 4.5 text pages). In the remaining 14 target locations meaningful sentences were presented as a control condition. 2.4 Procedure The experiment was advertised as “relaxed reading”. Upon arrival, readers were instructed to relax on the chair and to find a comfortable position to sit in. Readers’ task was to read the stories for comprehension, and it was emphasized that they should read in a relaxed manner. Participants were told that the text would sometimes be more or less incoherent. They were informed about the various kinds of errors that might occur and this was illustrated by example sentences. Participants were instructed to press the space bar on the computer keyboard whenever they noticed an error in the text. At the beginning of the experiment, participants read three pages of text for practice, each containing one error. They then read the 50 stories of Exp. 1 and Exp. 2. Between experiments, participants were allowed to take a short break where they could stand up and stretch. Within a given experiment, story order was randomized for each subject. Readers could move forwards and backwards in the text by pressing arrow keys on the keyboard. We allowed readers to move backwards in the text to ease transitions into a relaxed reading mode. Presentation of each page of text was preceded by a fixation check to ensure calibration quality. Successful error detection was defined as pressing the space bar on the keyboard after reading an error sentence and before moving onto the next text page. After reading all texts, participants completed two memory tests, the details of which are not reported here. 2.5 Data processing and analysis The cognitive parsing algorithm of the SR Research EyeLink software was used to determine the positions and durations of readers’ individual fixations. Fixations were then assigned to pages and lines of text, individual words, and letters (Supplementary Information). (Generalized) Linear mixed effects models ([G]LMMs, Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008; Kliegl, Masson, & Richter, 2010; Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) were used to test differences between mindless and mindful reading, and the control condition (Supplementary Information). (G)LMMs can be viewed as a generalization of linear regression and allow estimation of random effects (i.e., effects of factor levels that are randomly sampled from a population; here: participants, words, and text pages) in addition to fixed effects [i.e., effects that are repeatable across experiments and can be either discrete (e.g., experiment number) or continuous (e.g., word frequency)]. For large sample sizes the t-statistic effectively corresponds to the z-statistic. Therefore, for the LMMs (two-tailed testing), we took absolute t values larger than 1.645 to indicate marginal significant effects (p <.10), values larger than 1.96 to indicate significant effects (p <.05), and t values larger than 2.576 (p <.01) or 3.291 (p <.001) to indicate highly significant effects (cf. Kliegl, Ping, Dambacher, Yan, & Zhou, 2011). 2.6 Data selection For analyses of eye movements, errors with an overall detection rate of less than 30% were excluded (12.2%). Eye movements from false alarm trials were discarded. To unconfound mindless reading and skimming we excluded trials in which less than 50% of the words in the error sentence were fixated (4.0% of trials; Supplementary Information), leaving a total of 1793 trials for analyses. Under the assumption that readers were already on/off task on the words prior to the error (Reichle et al., 2010; Smallwood et al., 2007), we first analyzed eye movements in an interval of 14 words preceding each error sentence. Next, we generalized the analyses to different interval sizes using the same selection criteria. Only words on the same page of text as the error sentence and only eye movements made during the first viewing of each page of text were analyzed. Also, in each trial we only analyzed eye movements that were made prior to fixating any of the words from the error sentence so that the analyses did not include data from the error sentence, nor data that was collected after subjects had read the error sentence. (For the measure of the “number of reading passes” we made an exception to this selection criterion and also included fixations made after reading the error sentence.) For the 14-words interval, the selection resulted in a total of 24,528 fixations on 20,498 words and 19,313 first-pass fixations on 15,539 words. (Firstpass fixations include all fixations on a word before the reader makes a regression back to this word or previous words in the text.) To select valid word-based fixation time measures like gaze duration (i.e., the cumulative duration of all first-pass fixations per word), standard criteria used in reading research were applied (e.g., removing calibration problems, blinks, irregular fixation behavior [lines with less than 50% fixated words], first and last fixation per line, long and short fixations and saccades; see Supplementary Information). This procedure resulted in valid gaze durations for 9435 words, including 11,106 first-pass fixations. Overall, there were slightly more words with invalid first-pass fixations during mindless reading (40.9%) than during the control condition (38.9%), and mindful reading (38.7%), mainly because there were more lines with irregular fixation behavior and more calibration problems during mindless reading (Supplementary Information). 3 Results It took readers an average of 2h and 45min (range: 1:40h–4:20h) to read all texts. 3.1 Error detection Readers overlooked 39% of the errors in Exp. 1, and 44% of the errors in Exp. 2. False alarm rate, reflecting responses in the control condition without errors, was 7% in Exp. 1 and 3% in Exp. 2. We used signal detection theory (Wickens, 2002) to assess readers’ ability to detect errors (i.e., the sensitivity for errors, d′, reflecting the propensity for mindful reading) and response bias (c). When studying mindless reading we inevitably observe highly imbalanced data. These are adequately handled by (generalized) linear mixed effects models [(G)LMMs], which we used to implement the signal detection analyses (Wright, Horry, & Skagerberg, 2009, Supplementary Information). Experiments did not significantly differ in sensitivity (Exp. 1: d′=1.90; Exp. 2: d′=2.15; p >.10) and there was a marginal effect in response bias (Exp. 1: c =−1.55; Exp. 2: c =−1.98, z =1.68, p <.10) reflecting slightly fewer responses in Exp. 2. Sensitivity for errors decreased over the course of Exp. 2 [Δd′(per page of text)=−0.014, z =−1.94, p =.052], but not across Exp. 1 (p =.50; slope-difference between experiments: Δd′=0.017, z =2.01, p <.05). Fig. 2 depicts how sensitivity differed between error types (for both experiments: p <.001). Planned contrasts revealed that these differences followed the predictions: in Exp. 1, readers were most sensitive to (i) semantic errors, followed by (ii) discourse errors (difference to semantic errors: Δd′=−0.80, z =5.73, p <.001), and (iii) gibberish text (difference to discourse errors: Δd′=−0.31, z =2.40, p <.05). In Exp. 2, readers were most sensitive to (i) lexical errors, followed by (ii) syntactic errors (Δd′=−0.46, z =3.02, p <.01), (iii) semantic errors (Δd′=−0.04, z =0.26, p =.79), and (iv) gibberish text (Δd′=−0.54, z =3.63, p <.001). Thus, readers more easily noticed low-level errors, and were less sensitive to high-level errors. This finding is compatible with the idea that different levels of attentional decoupling led to overlooking of different kinds of errors. 3.2 Analyses of eye-movements We hypothesized that overlooking an error indicates an episode of mindless reading. Assuming that most of the time readers were already off task on the words before the error (Reichle et al., 2010; Smallwood et al., 2007), we first analyzed eye movements made in an interval of 14 words preceding each error sentence. To test the generality of the findings, follow-up analyses considered different interval lengths. Unless otherwise noted, data from different types of errors and from the two experiments were pooled for analyses. Global analyses focused on common measures of eye movements used in reading research (Rayner, 1998, 2009). Nine word-based measures of fixation durations and saccade probabilities were computed (Supplementary Information). For the analyses we used (G)LMMs to investigate how fixed effects (like mindless reading) affect measures of eye fixations, and determined regression coefficients, b, to estimate the size of these influences. Unless otherwise noted we used unstandardized regression coefficients, where b estimates the change in the dependent variable given a one-unit change in the independent variable. Out of the nine measures, only one measure significantly differed between mindless and mindful reading: readers read words with fewer passes during mindless reading as compared to mindful reading (b =0.10; t =5.0, p <.001). Differences in any of the other eight variables were not significant (Supplementary Information). Next, we performed local analyses to test whether the influence of lexical and linguistic variables on gaze durations is reduced during mindless reading as compared to mindful reading or the control condition. As can be seen in Fig. 3 A sentence- and clause-final words were fixated longer than other words, replicating the wrap-up effect found in many reading studies (Just & Carpenter, 1980; Warren et al., 2009). The average wrap-up effect across all reading conditions (mindful, mindless, and control) was not present in the LMM (t =−1.47, p >.10; Supplementary Information) after statistically controlling for word length, word frequency, and random between-word variance. Notably, the wrap-up effect was strongly reduced in the mindless reading condition (Fig. 3A), and this difference was significant (wrap-up in mindless versus mindful condition: b =−18.0, t =−1.90, p <.10; control versus mindless: b =23.7, t =2.15, p <.05), and did not differ between experiments (|ts|<0.8, ps>.10). 3 Post-hoc tests showed that the difference in the wrap-up effect between the mindful condition and the control did not exceed the level of chance (t =0.63, p >.10). 3 Prior to overlooking errors in Exp. 2, the effects of lexical variables on gaze durations were reduced. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, readers overall looked longer at long words than at short words. They also looked longer at words of low frequency than at words of high frequency, and the effect of word frequency was stronger for long than for short words (all |ts|⩾2.9, ps<.01), replicating key findings in reading research (Kliegl et al., 2006; Rayner, 1998). However, these effects were considerably reduced during episodes of mindless reading. Word length (1/wl) had a weaker effect on gaze durations during mindless reading than during mindful reading (b =155, t =1.93, p <.10) or the control condition (b =−195, t =−1.93, p <.10). The main effect of word frequency (log10 freq) did not significantly differ between mindless reading and mindful reading or the control condition (|ts|⩽1.4, ps>.10). The word frequency effect, however, was hardly modulated by word length during states of mindless reading (Fig. 3B, left panel). Statistically, this modulation was much weaker than during mindful reading (b =−175, t =−4.6, p <.001) or the control condition (b =92, t =1.95, p <.10). As is visible in Fig. 3B, for long words the frequency effect was strongly reduced during mindless reading (b =15, t =2.8, p <.01; for post hoc tests see Supplementary Information). For short words, the frequency effect was not significant during mindful reading, but marginally significant during mindless reading, and the slope-difference was significant. It may be that lexical processing of short words is more automatic and does not require the kind of higher-level attention measured in our paradigm. In summary, lexical processing effects were reduced before errors were overlooked in Exp. 2, indicating episodes of deep mindless reading. Next, we (a) extended our local analyses presented in Fig. 3 to intervals ranging from 10 to 20 words prior to the error and (b) performed more explicit tests for differences between experiments. When participants were in the initial phase of the reading task in Exp. 1 we expected that during mindless reading cognitive processing might be weakly decoupled from the text. Accordingly, high-level influences on gaze durations should be reduced but low-level influences may be intact. In contrast, after having spent much time in the lab reading boring texts readers may pay less attention to the reading task in Exp. 2, and cognitive processing may be deeply decoupled during mindless reading. Hence, text processing should fail at all levels of processing and both high-level as well as low-level influences should be decoupled. Fig. 4 displays standardized regression coefficients representing the relative influences of high-level wrap-up and low-level lexical (word frequency×length interaction) variables on gaze durations during mindless and mindful reading. The results show that wrap-up effects were reduced during mindless reading (Fig. 4, left panels) for all intervals [marginal (ts>1.7, ps<.10) to significant (ts<2.1, ps>.01) reduction; 20-words: t =1.54, p >.10] and this effect did not significantly differ between experiments (|ts|<0.95, ps>.10). 4 Note that the coefficients for the wrap-up effect during mindless reading were negative for Exp. 1. The reason for this is unclear. The difference between mindful and mindless reading, however, was as expected. 4 In our previous analyses (Fig. 3B) we had found that in Exp. 2 the word frequency effect was reduced during mindless reading for long words (but not for short words). Fig. 4 (lower right panel) shows that this effect was highly reliable for all intervals (ts>2.80, ps<.01; mindful versus mindless reading). However, it was absent in Exp. 1 (|ts|<0.63, ps>.10), and the difference between experiments was significant for all intervals (ts<−1.97, ps<.05). Taken together, for Exp. 1 we observed a dissociation between reduced high-level wrap-up effects and intact low-level lexical effects (Fig. 4, upper panels), which provides support for our expectation that cognitive processing was weakly decoupled when mindless reading occurred in the initial part of the study. For Exp. 2, however, the results indicate states of deep decoupling as both high-level wrap-up effects as well as low-level lexical influences on gaze durations were reduced during mindless reading (Fig. 4, lower panels). A central prediction that emerges from the proposed levels of inattention hypothesis is that overlooking different kinds of errors reflects different levels of attentional decoupling. To further test this prediction we analyzed eye movements for different error types. For the analyses we defined three broad categories of error types: (a) high-level errors (gibberish text and discourse errors), (b) medium-level errors (semantic and syntactic errors), and (c) low-level errors (lexical errors). This aggregation helped to reduce complexity and to improve the stability and reliability of the LMM analyses. We then generated a statistical measure for attentional decoupling: for the high-level wrap-up and the low-level lexical variable, we determined the influence of this variable on gaze durations (by computing the standardized regression coefficient in an LMM). Next, we determined how this influence differs between mindless and mindful reading. The resulting difference-value (coded as an interaction between lexical/linguistic influences and mindless reading) represents a direct statistical measure for attentional decoupling: Negative difference-values indicate that linguistic influences on eye movements are reduced when errors are overlooked. Based on the levels of inattention hypothesis we predict that for low-level errors decoupling should be observed for low-level (lexical) and for high-level (wrap-up) influences, whereas for high-level errors high-level wrap-up effects should be reduced, but low-level lexical effects should be relatively less affected. For the high-level wrap-up effect (Fig. 5 , left panel) the results suggest that decoupling was present for overlooking of all error types (negative difference-values), and the effect did not significantly differ between error categories (for all intervals: χ 2s(2)<1.6, ps>.47). This finding suggests that when any type of error is overlooked high-level processing is decoupled from the text. (Note that the wrap-up effect is overall smaller in size compared to the word frequency×length interaction.) For the low-level lexical influences (Fig. 5, right panel) the results show that the influence ofword frequency and length was strongly reduced when low-level errors were overlooked, but were only slightly affected when high-level errors were overlooked. The difference between error categories was significant for all intervals larger than 12 words (χ 2s(2)>5.7, ps<.06). These findings support our hypothesis that overlooking different types of errors in the SAST reflects graded levels of attentional decoupling: overlooking low-level errors indicated a state of deep decoupling as both high-level and low-level influences on eye movements were reduced. Overlooking high-level errors, to the contrary, indicated a state of weak decoupling as eye movement markers for high-level integration processes were reduced, but low-level lexical processes were intact. 3.3 Predicting mindless reading from eye movements Is it possible to infer from the ongoing eye movements whether readers are currently paying attention to the text? To investigate this question, we selected a subset of the data where we expected the strongest effects of mindless reading. Our results suggest that effects of mindless reading on eye movements are most pronounced for lexical processing of long words (Fig. 3B). For the analyses we used gaze durations on very long target words (⩾10 letters), which were located an average of 13.4 words prior to the upcoming error in the text. In addition, we focused our analysis on lexical errors because these should best capture reduced lexical processing (cf. Fig. 5). As is visible in Fig. 6 A+B, distributions of gaze durations on target words considerably differed between deep mindless as opposed to mindful reading, and the direction of the effect was consistent with the general findings reported above. During mindful reading we observed a standard word frequency effect, as gaze durations on low-frequency words were considerably prolonged and gaze durations on high-frequency words were shortened. To the contrary, when lexical errors were overlooked during deep mindless reading target word frequency did not clearly modulate the distribution of gaze durations. Based on these clear-cut results, we performed a Bayesian analysis to predict mindless reading from the gaze durations readers made on specific target words. Based on the graded nature of decoupling, we estimated the prior probability for mindlessness, P(mindless), from the overall rate with which errors were overlooked in Exp. 2. The posterior probability for mindless reading given a certain eye fixation, P(mindless|gaze), was determined via Bayesian logistic regression (Gelman, Jakulin, Pittau, & Su, 2008). We found that the posterior probability for mindless reading was low when readers’ eyes responded to the lexical difficulty of the target word: mindless reading was least likely when readers made long gaze durations on low frequency target words [P(mindless|low freq, gaze ⩾500ms)=.33, for continuous predictions see Fig. 6C+D] or when they made relatively short fixations on high frequency target words [P(mindless|high freq, gaze<500ms)=.42]. To the contrary, the probability for mindless reading was high when readers’ eyes did not respond to the lexical difficulty of the target word: failing to slow down the eyes on difficult low-frequency words predicted mindless reading [P(mindless|low freq, gaze<500ms)=.60]; likewise, failing to speed up on easy high frequency words was an indicator for an absent mind [P(mindless|high freq, gaze ⩾500ms)=.63]. From the posterior probability for mindless reading (Fig. 6C+D) we predicted error detection in the error sentence: We predicted mindless reading when the posterior probability for mindless reading exceeded a critical threshold, and predicted mindful reading when the posterior probability fell below the critical threshold. We used different prediction thresholds, corresponding to different prior expectations for the occurrence of mindless reading, to predict different levels of decoupling. Predictions were successful and significant for a wide range of decision thresholds and reached up to 68.3% correct predictions for deep mindless reading (see Fig. 6E). This finding demonstrates that an individual fixation duration measured on a specific target word in real time can be highly informative about whether a reader’s attention is currently focused on the text, or whether it is wandering. Notably, given the average total reading time of 356ms and the average target word-error distance of 13.4 words, we predicted overlooking of lexical errors an average of 4.8s before they occurred in the text. This finding suggests that the actual accuracy with which eye movements measure states of mindless reading should be higher than the current estimate of 68.3%. Moreover, predictions were based on information from individual gaze durations readers made on individual target words, and predictions may be further improved by combining information from several words in a trial and from multiple eye movement measures. 4 Discussion In the current study, we investigated episodes of mind wandering during reading, where cognitive processing is decoupled from the text as external attention is reduced. Coupled and decoupled processing are often treated as a dichotomy. The central aim of the present work was to introduce the levels of inattention hypothesis, which proposes graded attentional decoupling at hierarchical levels of cognitive processing. To measure levels of attentional decoupling we developed the sustained attention to stimulus task (SAST), a behavioral measure for mindless reading, which is based on readers’ sensitivity for errors in the text. We tested predictions from the levels of inattention hypothesis and the cascade model of inattention by performing detailed and reliable analyses of a large corpus of eye-movement data during mindless reading. We found that eye movements were decoupled from low-level and high-level linguistic variables in a hierarchically graded fashion before errors were overlooked. In a Bayesian analysis, we demonstrated that it is possible to use eye movements to predict overlooking of errors 5s before they occur, and this suggests that eye movements provide an unobtrusive online-indicator for mind wandering. Our findings support the levels of inattention hypothesis and validate the SAST as a behavioral measure of mindless reading. Attentional decoupling in the SAST: As a main result, we found that readers overlooked errors about 40% of the time. What factors caused readers to overlook these errors? First, the percentage of overlooked errors is compatible with the estimated amount of time people spend mind wandering in everyday life (Kane et al., 2007; Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010), suggesting that we were successful in creating task conditions to investigate mindless reading in the eye-tracking laboratory. Second, mind wandering is known to become more frequent with increasing time on task (Schnitzer & Kowler, 2006; Smallwood et al., 2007; Smallwood & Schooler, 2006) and we replicated this finding in our data. Third, we controlled for skimming as an alternative explanation, and found global eye movement measures to be unaffected when errors were overlooked. Indeed, during mindless reading fixations were sometimes longer (cf. Reichle et al., 2010) and sometimes shorter (cf. Franklin et al., 2011) compared to mindful reading depending on whether high or low frequency target words were fixated. These findings indicate that errors may have been overlooked during episodes of mindless reading because cognitive processing is decoupled from the text. We included different types of errors in the text to measure different levels of mindless reading. The levels of inattention hypothesis predicts that readers should be very sensitive to low-level errors and less sensitive to high-level errors. This prediction was supported by the experimental findings. Readers quite often overlooked high-level errors, like discourse errors and gibberish text. In these cases, high-level text processing may have ceased during episodes of weak mindless reading. Supporting evidence for this interpretation comes from the observation that low-level errors, like lexical and syntactic errors, were rarely overlooked. This finding is compatible with the interpretation that low-level linguistic processes like word recognition or syntactic parsing may be disrupted when low-level errors are overlooked, indicating episodes of deep mindless reading. Collectively, these results are compatible with the levels of inattention hypothesis. However, the alternative dichotomy-hypothesis can explain differences in sensitivity between error types by assuming differences in the durations of mind wandering episodes. The present eye movement analyses help distinguishing between these explanations. Decoupling of eye movements: To investigate more closely how text processing changes when errors are overlooked, we performed local eye movement analyses. During mindful reading, readers slowed down to integrate words toward the end of phrases and sentences. Interestingly, this wrap-up effect was absent before errors were overlooked. This finding suggests that during mindless reading readers overlooked errors in the text because they did not integrate words to construct sentence meaning and to comprehend the text. Moreover, during mindful reading fixation durations were modulated by variables word length and frequency, which constitute empirical markers for word recognition processes. In contrast, before overlooking of errors (Exp. 2) these effects were clearly reduced (Figs. 3–5), and sometimes completely absent (Fig. 6).This finding suggests that errors were overlooked during deep mindless reading because processes of word recognition were incomplete. Importantly, mindless reading affected eye movements on up to 20 words preceding an error sentence (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, overlooking of errors did not occur because text processing was locally reduced when reading a single sentence or word. Instead, readers’ minds were drifting off task over an extended period of time prior to encountering an error. In sum, the present findings suggest that overlooking errors in the SAST indicates episodes of attentional decoupling during mindless reading, where errors are overlooked because text processing is reduced. While the present results suggest that overlooking errors in the SAST indicates episodes of mindless reading, there may be other specific factors that also contribute to overlooking of errors. Some of these may result from an absent mind; for example, monitoring of text comprehension (Palincsar & Brown, 1984; Smallwood et al., 2007) or memory for task instructions (McVay & Kane, 2009) may be reduced during mindless reading, and may cause readers to overlook errors in the text. Moreover, factors unrelated to mind wandering may lead to overlooking of errors, and may inflate our estimates for the occurrence of mind wandering. Also, decoupling of eye movements from the text may partially result from differences in reading ability or strategy between subjects. It should be noted, however, that we controlled for such effects in the LMM analyses. Importantly, the present eye movement results demonstrate that overlooking an error was preceded by a period of reduced cognitive text processing, indicating an episode of attentional decoupling. Hypotheses on the nature of attentional decoupling: We derived several predictions from hypotheses of attentional decoupling (Fig. 1) and tested these by analyzing eye-movement data. Critically, the levels of inattention hypothesis predicts states of weak attentional decoupling, where high-level processes are decoupled from the external environment, but low-level processes are still intact. We found eye-movement evidence for weak decoupling in Exp. 1. Here, wrap-up effects, as a measure for high-level integration processes, were reduced when errors were overlooked, but low-level lexical processes (i.e., the frequency × length interaction) remained unaffected. Deep mindless reading, to the contrary, was observed in Exp. 2, when readers had already spent much time in the lab reading boring texts. Here, not only high-level wrap-up, but even low-level lexical effects were reduced before errors were overlooked. As predicted by the cascade model of inattention (Smallwood, 2011; Smallwood et al., 2007), the consequences of the low-level decoupling in Exp. 2 may have cascaded into the cognitive system to impair higher-level wrap-up processing. These results demonstrate that graded states of weak (Exp. 1) and deep (Exp. 2) attentional decoupling can be distinguished. This finding is incompatible with a dichotomous view on attentional decoupling and provides support for the levels of inattention hypothesis. A central prediction from the levels of inattention hypothesis is that overlooking different types of errors reflects different levels of attentional decoupling. The eye-movement data lend support to this prediction. When low-level (lexical) errors were overlooked, eye movements were decoupled from low-level (lexical) variables, and – as predicted by the cascade model of inattention (Smallwood, 2011; Smallwood et al., 2007) – also high-level (wrap-up) influences were reduced (Fig. 5). When high-level errors (discourse errors and gibberish text) were overlooked, however, then decoupling was present only for high-level integration processes (reduced wrap-up effect), but low-level lexical processing was barely affected. These eye movement results suggest that overlooking of low-level errors may indicate states of deep attentional decoupling, whereas overlooking high-level errors may indicate states of weak decoupling. These findings support the levels of inattention hypothesis and the cascade model of inattention, but are incompatible with the dichotomy-hypothesis. As noted above, the dichotomy-hypothesis of mind wandering may explain differences in sensitivity between error types by assuming variable durations rather than variable degrees of attentional decoupling. For example, task focus during the reading of a single pseudo-word is sufficient to detect the lexical error, and the error can be detected even if attention switches quickly between mindless and mindful reading. Thus, overlooking low-level errors may reflect short-lived episodes of decoupling. To the contrary, to detect high-level discourse errors, attention must be devoted to the text during reading of at least two adjacent sentences, and overlooking high-level errors may thus indicate longer episodes of decoupling. These predictions from the dichotomy-hypothesis were not supported by the present eye movement results: fixation durations were decoupled from cognitive processing up to 20 words before encountering an error sentence, and this interval was similar (or even longer) for low-level errors (see Fig. 5). The eye movement findings therefore suggest that overlooking low-level errors was not only associated with deeper decoupling, but potentially also with longer episodes of attentional decoupling compared to high-level errors. Both of these findings are incompatible with the dichotomous view of attentional decoupling, and are consistent with the levels of inattention hypothesis. 5 Conclusions Cognitive science has generated theoretical models that describe different aspects of reading (Engbert et al., 2005; Graesser et al., 2002; Reichle et al., 2009; Staub, 2011) and cognition in general (Cohen, 2000; Craik & Lockhart, 1972; Gazzaniga, 2009) as hierarchically organized processes, where information is represented and processed at various lower and higher levels. A long research tradition has investigated how attention affects processing at such early and late levels (Broadbent, 1958; Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963; Driver, 2001), and the field seems to agree on a continuously graded rather than a dichotomous view of attentional selection (Chun et al., 2011; Mangun & Hillyard, 1995; Treisman, 1960). Here, we investigated how cognitive processing at different levels becomes decoupled from external information when the mind wanders away from an external reading task. Our results indicate that attentional processes during reading may be of a hierarchically graded nature. Low-level processes turned out to be quite robust against lapses in external attention and seemed to fail only when the mind was deeply absent from the current task. High-level text integration processes, to the contrary, seemed to be far more fragile and drifted off the reading task with high frequency. This result supports hierarchical models of reading and cognition. The levels of inattention hypothesis together with the cascade model of inattention provide a framework to understand and describe graded attentional decoupling at such different levels. Importantly, our findings suggest that the level of inattention may strongly vary between experiments, between experimental conditions, or measures of mind wandering, and what level of inattention is assessed in a specific study may strongly influence experimental results. Therefore, to understand and avoid potential inconsistencies, we suggest that it may be helpful to explicitly measure the depth or degree of decoupling in future studies. Questions for future research: Our findings raise a new, important and open theoretical question: What factors cause decoupling at a specific weak or deep level? Based on previous theorizing, we speculate about possible causes. First, executive control processes may fail (McVay & Kane, 2009, 2010) to varying degrees and controlled high-level processes may be reduced more readily than more automatic low-level processes (Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). Second, one question is how stimulus independent thought (SIT) is related to the graded levels of attentional decoupling. One possibility is that similar to attentional decoupling, SITs are graded in nature. Another is that SIT emerge only at a particularly deep level of decoupling. Third, the adaptive gain theory of norepinephrine function (Aston-Jones, Rajkowski, & Cohen, 1999) has been proposed as a neurophysiological basis for mind wandering (Smallwood et al., 2011, 2012), and different levels of inattention may result from different degrees of drowsiness and inactivity (“off” state of low locus coeruleus [LC] activity) versus increased vigilance and labile attention (“tonic” mode with high baseline LC activity). Fourth, people may become aware of their wandering mind (Schooler, 2002; Schooler et al., 2011) more easily when their cognitive processing is deeply decoupled from the external environment (as opposed to when it is only weakly decoupled), and they may therefore direct their minds back on task more often. Another important question for future research concerns the relation of behavioral measures of attentional decoupling (like the SAST) to more subjective aspects of mind wandering. For example, our findings may trigger research to vigorously test the view that SIT is a dichotomous (versus graded) process, and to learn about how graded decoupling is related to (graded or dichotomous) aspects of SIT. Likewise, in self-report studies of mind wandering it is possible to assess whether participants are meta-aware about their mind wandering (Schooler, 2002; Schooler et al., 2011). In fact, a recent fMRI study (Christoff et al., 2009) found that deeper levels of mind wandering [measured as increased activity in the default network and in the executive system (also see Christoff, 2012)] may be associated with lack of meta-awareness, and this suggests that our paradigm may have the potential to capture subjective awareness of mindless reading in an objective behavioral measure. Predicting mindless reading from eye movements: As a novel contribution, we demonstrated that gaze durations predicted overlooking of lexical errors 5s before the error occurred in the text. Thus, recordings of individual eye movements can predict in real time whether a reader is currently in a state of mindless reading at the level of an individual trial. Such a measure may prove highly useful in diverse applications. Objective measures are useful to investigate mindlessness in populations unable to report about their wandering mind, like children or psychiatric patient groups. They could potentially be used to identify and overcome mind wandering in educational or professional settings. They could serve to diagnose individual differences in mind wandering, to objectively evaluate the quality of different texts, or to detect mindlessness in cognitive experiments or crucial real-world tasks like driving (D’Orazio, Leo, Guaragnella, & Distante, 2007) or closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring. In research on reading, detecting mindlessness online allows to apply sophisticated eye tracking techniques, like gaze-contingent display changes (McConkie & Rayner, 1975; Rayner, 1975, 1998), during mindless reading to investigate in detail how text processing changes when readers’ minds are off task. Finally, objective measures are highly valuable tools for studying mind wandering – when investigating factors influencing the propensity to mind wandering (Sayette, Reichle, & Schooler, 2009; Sayette, Schooler, & Reichle, 2010), the consequences of off-task thought (Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010; Smallwood, McSpadden, & Schooler, 2007), the neural structures (Buckner et al., 2008; Christoff et al., 2009; Mason et al., 2007) and cognitive processes (Levinson et al., 2012; McVay & Kane, 2010; Smallwood, 2010b; Smallwood & Schooler, 2006) that initiate, terminate, and support mind wandering and the default mode.

Fig. 1 Experiment 1: Schematic of trial procedure and stimuli. Example trials from the four possible combinations of prime–action compatibility and PCE/NCE. Participants were instructed to respond to the target stimuli, and were not informed of the presence of the primes. Primes and masks could appear randomly above or below fixation on each trial. On PCE trials, the mask–target Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) was 0, with the mask appearing within the inner cutout of the target. On NCE trials, the mask–target SOA was 110ms, with the target being presented immediately after the mask disappeared. Participants were asked to estimate how much control they felt they had over the colour patch that appeared 100, 300, or 500ms, after their response. AEI: Action-effect interval. Fig. 2 Experiment 1: Mean response times (ms), mean error rates (%), and mean control ratings, on compatible and incompatible trials, for each mask–target SOA (PCE/NCE). At NCE latencies, the positive compatibility effect (PCE) on performance measures is reversed (response times), or abolished (error rates), so that performance costs now occur on compatible trials and benefits on incompatible trials. However, the relationship between compatibility and sense of control is similar under PCE and NCE conditions: participants felt more in control in compatibly-primed than incompatibly-primed trials, irrespective of how priming affected performance. All error bars indicate SEM. *: p <.05; **: p <.005. Fig. 3 Experiment 2: Schematic of trial procedure and stimuli. Example trials from the two PCE/NCE conditions with neutral primes. The experimental design also included four other types of trials, as in Experiment 1: compatible and incompatible trials with left- or right-pointing arrow primes, and PCE/NCE conditions (not shown). AEI: Action-effect interval. Fig. 4 Experiment 2: Mean response times (ms), mean error rates (%), and mean control ratings, on compatible and incompatible and neutral trials, for each mask–target SOA (PCE/NCE). All error bars indicate SEM. *: p <.05. Fig. 5 Regression analyses between prime discrimination performance (d′) and control ratings in compatible and incompatible trials of PCE and NCE conditions. The linear regression lines are shown in red. (a) PCE trials; (b) NCE trials. The red dashed line around the regression line represents the 95% confidence interval (CI).” (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 6 Dissociating sense of control from performance monitoring. Upper panel (a) time course of sub-threshold response activation following a right-pointing prime that is either compatible (black) or incompatible (grey) with the upcoming target. When no additional evidence – such as a compatible target – confirms the initial prime-induced activation, it is automatically inhibited. This inhibition leads to relative facilitation of the incompatible activation. Thus, when the target occurs, the motor activation threshold can be reached faster than in the compatible case, creating the NCE (adapted from Sumner and Husain (2008)). (b) Two processes contributing to sense of control. Action-effect matching: Control can be retrospectively inferred from comparing the predicted effect of a response with its actual effect using a comparator. The sense of control is inversely related to the comparator output. Lower grey panel: In addition, sense of control depends on an early signal generated during action selection, and temporarily held in an intentional buffer, in advance of the action itself. This signal is positively related to sense of control. Sense of control depends on fluency of action selection, not motor performance Valerian Chambon Patrick Haggard ⁎ p.haggard@ucl.ac.uk Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, United Kingdom ⁎ Corresponding author.

Highlights ► Priming actions speeds responding and increases sense of agency over action effects. ► Increasing prime–target delays reverses priming of reactions, but not of agency. ► Monitoring of performance does not strongly contribute to sense of agency. ► Instead, sense of agency depends on fluency of early action selection signals. ► A metacognitive ‘feeling of doing’ contributes to sense of agency over action effects. Abstract Sense of agency refers to the feeling of controlling one’s own actions, and, through these actions, events in the outside world. Sense of agency is widely held to involve a retrospective inference based on matching actual effects of an action with its expected effects. We hypothesise a second, prospective aspect of sense of agency, reflecting the fluency of action selection, based on results from subliminal priming of actions. When people responded to a target that was compatible with a preceding subliminal prime, they felt stronger sense of control over a subsequent colour effect than when the preceding prime was incompatible. Importantly, compatible and incompatible primes had the same predictive statistical relation to the colour effect. We next investigated whether differences in sense of control could be based on monitoring motor performance. By varying the timings of mask and target, we compared sense of control between a Positive Compatibility condition, where compatible primes facilitated performance, and a Negative Compatibility condition, where compatible primes impaired performance. We found that compatible priming again enhanced sense of control, irrespective of its effects on performance. We present a simple model of the prospective aspect of sense of agency, in which early signals reflecting action selection processing make a direct, experiential contribution to sense of control. Sense of agency may be partly based on an experience-based ‘feeling of doing’, analogous to the metacognitive ‘feeling of knowing’. Keywords Action selection Subliminal priming Sense of agency Performance monitoring Negative compatibility effect Metacognition 1 Introduction Sense of agency refers to the feeling of controlling one’s own actions, and, through these actions, events in the outside world. Previous research suggested that this subjective feeling of control depends strongly on predicting outcomes: sense of agency gets stronger as the match between predicted and actual action outcomes gets closer (Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith, 1998; Farrer et al., 2008; Linser & Goschke, 2007; Moore & Haggard, 2008; Sato & Yasuda, 2005; Wegner & Wheatley, 1999). For example, if I intend to turn on the light by pressing a switch, and the light comes on after I press the switch, then I am likely to feel that I caused the light to come on. On this view, the basic computation underlying sense of agency involves matching the intended effects of action against its actual effects (Farrer et al., 2003; Farrer & Frith, 2002). Interestingly, this computation can only be performed retrospectively, after information about outcomes becomes available, even though the intention to achieve a given outcome includes a future-directed component (Pacherie, 2000, 2008). For example, people may monitor whether their actions produce the effects they expected, and thus metacognitively infer whether they caused those effects or not (Miele, Wager, Mitchell, & Metcalfe, 2011). An alternative possibility, that sense of agency is partly generated prospectively, in advance of knowing the actual outcome of actions, has however received recent support (Nahab et al., 2011; Wenke, Fleming, & Haggard, 2010). On this view, selecting between alternative possible actions might itself generate a sense of agency. For example, faced with two electrical switches, if I deliberately choose the lighting switch rather than the heating switch, I may experience a stronger sense of control than if I hesitate in confusion over which switch to choose. Importantly, this difference in subjective experience of agency precedes action and outcome, and is independent of them. In both cases described above, I might actually press the lighting switch, and make the lights come on. Thus, monitoring signals generated at the point of action selection could contribute to a sense of agency, independently of objective facts of action execution and outcome. In a recent study, Wenke et al. (2010) investigated this prospective component of control using an experimental design that dissociated the processes of action selection from action–outcome matching. They used subliminal priming to manipulate fluency of selection between left and right keypresses in response to suprathreshold left- and right-pointing arrow targets. Subliminal prime arrow directions were either identical (compatible condition) or opposite (incompatible condition) to the subsequent target direction. Each keypress was followed by a colour patch. One set of colours was shown when prime and target were compatible, and another set when prime and target were incompatible. Participants reported a stronger sense of control over the colour patch when they acted compatibly with a prime that they could not even see, relative to incompatibly. Importantly, this effect was not due to predictability of action outcomes, since the relation between keypress action and colour outcome was always equally predictable. Rather, the stronger experience of control when prime and target were compatible could only be explained by the fluency of action selection – i.e., by an internal signal influenced by the prime–target relation. Crucially, this fluency-related signal must have been generated at the action selection stage and sampled before the action was executed (Wenke et al., 2010). Further, these primes were subliminal. Therefore, the changes that they caused in sense of control were unlikely to involve conscious metacognitive inference (Miele et al., 2011). Rather, compatible primes might have generated an experience-based form of metacognition: a ‘feeling of doing’ analogous to the well-studied ‘feeling of knowing’ (Koriat, 2000; Muñoz, 2011). However, the results are also compatible with a very different interpretation, which has no need for monitoring of internal fluency signals. Specifically, participants might perceive control based on monitoring of their own motor performance, for example their response times (RTs). Since RTs are lower on compatibly- than incompatibly-primed trials (Dehaene et al., 1998; Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2000; Schlaghecken, Rowley, Sembi, Simmons, & Whitcomb, 2007), participants would therefore feel more control on compatible trials, because they respond more rapidly. On this second view, agency would depend on retrospective monitoring of action execution performance (Corallo, Sackur, Dehaene, & Sigman, 2008; Marti, Sackur, Sigman, & Dehaene, 2010), not on prospective monitoring of premotor fluency signals. To distinguish between these two accounts of sense of control, we used an experimental procedure that dissociated fluency of action selection from RT monitoring. Specifically, we increased the interval between mask and target (see Fig. 1 ) to take advantage of a Negative Compatibility Effect (NCE) in priming. The NCE occurs only at longer mask–target intervals, and is generally interpreted as an automatic inhibition of an initially-primed response (Eimer & Schlaghecken, 1998, 2003; Klapp & Haas, 2005; Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005; Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2002, 2006; Sumner & Husain, 2008; but see Jaśkowski (2008) for an alternative account of this auto-inhibition process). If a prime-induced activation is not rapidly confirmed by a target, then an auto-inhibitory process is thought to suppress response activation below baseline, since the primed action is now shown to be inappropriate (see Fig. 6a, upper panel). Importantly, the locus of the NCE therefore lies after the action selection stage. Thus, compatible priming accelerates RTs at short mask–target latencies, (PCE), but paradoxically increases RTs at longer latencies (NCE). By combining this factor with our previous design for assessing sense of control, we could directly distinguish between performance monitoring and action selection accounts. A stronger experience of control on compatible trials, despite slower response times generated at NCE latencies, would provide strong evidence for a prospective contribution of action-selection fluency to sense of control. Alternatively, a stronger experience of control for faster responses, irrespective of prime compatibility, would provide evidence that sense of agency depends on performance monitoring. We tested these two predictions in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, we replicated our findings in a new sample of participants, additionally including trials with neutral primes. We also formally tested whether participants were conscious of the direction of primes stimuli. 2 Experiment 1 2.1 Material and methods 2.1.1 Participants Eighteen participants (8 females and 10 males aged 21–34years), with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were recruited to participate in the study. They provided written informed consent prior to the experiment and were paid €10 for their participation. The experiment was approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee. 2.1.2 Apparatus and materials The visual display was presented on a computer screen placed at about 60cm from the participant (display mode=800×600×32, 60Hz). The experiment was programmed and stimulations were delivered using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, California, http://www.neurobs.com). Primes consisted of grey left- or right-pointing arrows followed by isoluminant metacontrast masks constructed by superimposing left- and right-oriented primes (Fig. 1). The outer shape of the mask was rectangular. The targets were supraliminal arrows that unambiguously pointed to left or right, with a cutout large enough for the mask to fit without touching the inner contours of the target (Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005). Prime and mask stimuli could appear randomly above or below fixation to enhance the masking effect (Vorberg, Mattler, Heinecke, Schmidt, & Schwarzbach, 2003). Action outcomes were circular colour patches of red, green, blue, or yellow. All stimuli appeared on a grey background. 2.1.3 Design and procedure The task was to respond to the direction of the target arrow by pressing the corresponding response button with the right or left index finger. Examples of each (left and right) target were presented during experimental instruction so that participants would become acquainted with the target stimuli. No reference was made to the existence or appearance of the primes. On half of the trials in each block at random, the prime and the target (and therefore also the manual response) were compatible, while on the remaining trials they were incompatible (see Fig. 1). In addition, trials were randomly divided into PCE and NCE trials, by inserting (NCE) or omitting (PCE) a 110ms delay between mask and target (Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005). Action effects consisted of coloured circles that appeared on the screen 100, 300 or 500ms after the response to the target. This jitter in action-effect delay was introduced because delay strongly influences sense of control (Haggard, Clark, & Kalogeras, 2002; Wenke et al., 2010), and was therefore expected to increase the range of participants’ control ratings. Red, green, blue, or yellow colour patches were presented, according to whether the trial was prime–target compatible or prime–target incompatible. In each block, two colours (one for each hand) were assigned to prime-compatible responses, another two colours to prime-incompatible responses. Colours were rotated via a Latin square such that, across all four blocks, each colour appeared in each compatibility condition for each hand. After the colour patch was displayed, participants judged how much control they felt they had over the colour effect by using a scale ranging from 1 (no control) to 8 (complete control). When making their judgment, participants were explicitly given the instruction to judge the extent to which they thought they had controlled the appearance of the coloured patch through their action. The control judgement therefore concerned the causal relationship between the action and the consequent effect, rather than simply the effect, or simply the action alone. Such control judgements are a standard way of assessing retrospective agency while avoiding contamination by ‘self-other’ discrimination processes that are more relevant to “ownership” rather than to agency (see Synofzik, Vosgerau, and Newen (2008) for a review). Subjects were not told that they had in fact no real control over the appearance of the colour effect. 2.1.4 Timeline Each trial began with a central fixation cross which remained visible until the colour-effect stimulus appeared. The prime was presented for 17ms, followed by a mask after an SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony) of 33ms. Mask and target durations were both 110ms. These parameters were chosen because extensive previous studies showed that conscious perception of prime direction is impossible with these exposures (see Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005; Vorberg et al., 2003). In particular, the prime–mask asynchrony strongly influences prime visibility. Vorberg et al. (2003) found that participants could not report the identity of the primes at prime–mask SOAs from 14 to 70ms, even after extended practice of more than 3000 trials. Mask–target SOA was varied in order to induce either a PCE or a NCE, following the same procedure as in Lingnau and Vorberg (2005). On PCE trials, the mask–target SOA was 0, with the mask appearing within the inner cutout of the target. On NCE trials, the mask–target SOA was of 110ms, with the target being presented immediately after the mask disappeared. Note that trial events were timed so that the target stimulus always appeared 700ms after the fixation cross, irrespective of the PCE/NCE manipulation (see Fig. 1). The response window was set to 1200ms. If participants failed to respond within this time window, or made an incorrect response, they saw a black X instead of a coloured circle. The coloured patches representing action effects remained on the screen for 300ms. After a jittered delay (grey background) varying from 1 to 2s, a rating scale appeared for 1500ms, allowing the participant to judge the level of control she felt over the colour patch. Once the participant made her control judgment, the rating scale was replaced by a fixation cross until the end of the 1500ms response window. The experiment consisted of four blocks of 64 trials each. When an error occurred, the corresponding trial was repeated at the end of each block (up to 10 error trials per block), ensuring that all colours were seen equally often despite any errors. 2.1.5 Data analyses Error rates (ERs), response times (RTs) were analysed independently using 2×2 repeated-measures ANOVAs with prime–target compatibility (compatible vs. incompatible) and mask–target SOA (PCE vs. NCE) as within-subjects factors. Control ratings for colour effects were analysed using a 2×2×3 repeated-measures ANOVA with mask–target SOA, prime–target compatibility, and action-effect interval (100, 300, 500ms) as within-subjects factors. Post-hoc Fisher tests were used to identify differences between conditions. 2.2 Results 2.2.1 Response times Our analyses focused on demonstrating PCE and NCE effects. ANOVA showed no main effects of compatibility (F(1,17)=0.14, p =0.70) or mask–target SOA (F(1,17)=0.21, p =0.65). There was a significant interaction between mask–target SOA (i.e., PCE vs. NCE latencies) and prime–target compatibility (compatible vs. incompatible): (F(1,17)=12.36, p =0.002) (Fig. 2 , upper panel). As expected, on PCE trials, participants’ responses to arrow targets following compatible primes were faster than following incompatible primes (post-hoc Fisher test, p =0.013). Also as expected, NCE trials reversed the polarity of this effect, with participants’ responses being slower for compatible than for incompatible trials (post-hoc Fisher test, p =0.041) (see also Supplemental material, “Correlation analyses”, and Table S2). 2.2.2 Error rates There was no significant main effects of compatibility (F(1,17)=0.56, p =0.46) or mask–target SOA (F(1,17)=0.002, p =0.96). The interaction effect between mask–target SOA and compatibility was significant (F(1,17)=6.34, p =0.022) (Fig. 2b). On PCE trials, as predicted, participants made more errors in incompatible than in compatible trials (post-hoc Fisher test, p =0.019). On NCE trials, a numerical effect in the opposite direction was found, but did not reach significance (post-hoc Fisher test, p =0.34). 2.2.3 Control ratings First, we found a main effect of compatibility (F(1,17)=6.45, p =0.02). This replicated the effect reported previously by Wenke et al. (2010), with participants experiencing more control over the colour patch when primed compatibly than when primed incompatibly. There was also a trend towards a main effect of mask–target SOA (F(1,17)=3.38, p =0.083), with PCE trials producing higher control ratings than NCE trials. Importantly, the interaction between SOA and prime–target compatibility was far from significance (F(1,17)=0.43, p =0.521) (Fig. 2, lower panel). For comparability with the RT analysis, we also performed post-hoc tests comparing control ratings between compatible and incompatible trials in PCE (p =0.005) and NCE (p =0.03) conditions. In summary, on both PCE and NCE trials, participants experienced higher levels of control over action effects following compatible prime–target associations. In addition, we found a predicted main effect of action-effect interval (F(1,17)=46.38, p <0.001). Post-hoc testing showed that participants experienced strongest sense of control with 100ms response-effect intervals, less control with 300ms, and least control with 500ms (see Supplementary Table S1). All pairwise comparisons were significant (p <0.001). Importantly, there was no significant interaction between action-effect interval and compatibility (F(1,17)=0.47, p =0.62): thus, predictability of the effect did not differently influence sense of control across compatible and incompatible trials. There was a trend for a significant interaction between action-effect interval and SOA (F(1,17)=2.74, p =0.08). The three-way interaction between all the factors was far from significance (F(1,17)=0.04, p =0.96). 3 Experiment 2 3.1 Material and methods 3.1.1 Participants Twelve participants (6 females and 6 males aged 22–31years), with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were recruited to participate in the second experiment. The experiment consisted of two separate, but consecutive, tests: a PCE/NCE test (based on that presented in Experiment 1, but see below), followed by a prime discrimination test. All participants provided written informed consent and were paid €10 for their participation. 3.1.2 PCE/NCE test 3.1.2.1 Apparatus and materials Apparatus and materials were the same as in Experiment 1, except that neutral primes were also included, together with left- or right-pointing prime arrows. Neutral primes were constructed by superimposing left- and right-oriented primes (Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005) (see Fig. 3 ). 3.1.2.2 Design and procedure On one third of the trials in each block at random, the prime and the target were compatible, while on the other one third, they were incompatible. In the remaining one third of the trials, the primes were neutral. As in Experiment 1, trials were randomly divided into PCE and NCE trials, by inserting (NCE) or omitting (PCE) a 110ms delay between mask and target. The experiment consisted of six blocks of 54 trials each. When an error occurred, the corresponding trial was repeated at the end of each block (up to 10 error trials per block), ensuring that all colours were seen equally often despite any errors. The timeline in Experiment 2 was exactly the same as in the first experiment. 3.1.2.3 Data analyses Error rates (ERs) and response times (RTs) were analysed independently using 2×3 repeated-measures ANOVAs with prime–target relation (compatible vs. incompatible vs. neutral) and mask–target SOA (PCE vs. NCE) as within-subjects factors. Control ratings for colour effects were analysed using a 2×3×3 repeated-measures ANOVA with mask–target SOA, prime–target relation, and action-effect interval (100, 300, 500ms) as within-subjects factors. Post-hoc Fisher tests were used to identify differences between conditions. 3.1.3 Prime discrimination test Following the PCE/NCE experiment, each participant additionally performed a direct assessment of prime discriminability. Defining criteria for non-conscious perception is fraught with debate (Erdelyi, 2004). Criteria can be either subjective (based on self-report) or objective (based on forced-choice performance). As our aim in this investigation was to ensure the unconscious nature of our prime stimuli, we selected the more conservative, objective criterion of awareness. Furthermore, to ensure that the prime discrimination test was a valid measure of prime perception during the PCE/NCE experiment, we matched the designs of the prime discrimination and of the control task in as many ways as possible (Schmidt & Vorberg, 2006). Thus, in the prime discrimination task, participants were explicitly informed of the presence of a prime, and asked to identify its direction on each trial (left or right) using a left or right keypress. Other elements of the trial sequence remained identical to the PCE/NCE experiment, except that the colour effect was not presented (effect stimuli in the main experiment were in any case independent of prime direction). To ensure that conscious judgement of the prime direction was not contaminated by the unconscious activation of a motor response, participants were only permitted to report 600ms after the mask had appeared (Vorberg et al., 2003). The start of the reporting interval was signalled by a 1000Hz tone played for 150ms. The prime discriminability test consisted of two blocks of 54 trials each. Responses to the primes were analysed using signal detection theory (Green & Swets, 1966) allowing us to compute a measure of prime discriminability (d′) for each subject and each mask–target SOA condition (PCE/NCE). 3.2 Results 3.2.1 Response times ANOVA showed no main effects of prime–target relation (F(2,22)=0.32, p =0.72) or mask–target SOA (F(1,11)=0.91, p =0.35). There was a clear trend towards an interaction effect between mask–target SOA (i.e., PCE vs. NCE latencies) and prime–target relation (compatible vs. incompatible vs. neutral) (F(2,22)=3.00, p =0.07) (Fig. 4 , upper panel). This interaction followed the pattern of Experiment 1, and was explored further with post-hoc testing. As before, on PCE trials, participants’ responses to arrow targets following compatible primes were faster than following incompatible primes (416ms vs. 454ms; post-hoc Fisher test: p =0.04). NCE trials again reversed the polarity of this effect, with participants’ responses tending to be slower for compatible than for incompatible trials. However, the size of this effect was reduced compared to Experiment 1, and it did not achieve significance (465ms vs. 441ms; post-hoc Fisher test, p =0.19). On PCE trials, we found a numerical effect of compatible, relative to neutral, priming, with RTs tending to be faster in compatible trials than neutral trials (414ms vs. 434ms), whereas this effect tended to reverse on NCE trials, with responses following neutral trials tending to be faster than responses following compatible trials (438ms vs. 461ms). Note that these two numerical effects did however not reach significance (PCE: p = 0.31; NCE: p =0.16) (see also Supplemental material, “Correlation analyses”, and Table S3). 3.2.2 Error rates There was no significant main effects of prime–target relation (F(2,22)=0.34, p =0.71) or mask–target SOA (F(1,11)=0.66, p =0.43). The interaction effect between mask–target SOA and prime–target relation was not significant neither (F(2,22)=0.92, p =0.41) (Fig. 4, middle panel). On PCE trials, a numerical effect was found that was consistent with Experiment 1: participants made more errors in incompatible than in compatible (4.63% vs. 3.97%) and neutral trials (4.63% vs. 4.06%). The effect, however, did not reach significance (post-hoc Fisher test, incompatible vs. compatible, p =0.17; incompatible vs. neutral, p =0.22). 3.2.3 Control ratings Inspection of Fig. 4 shows that the experience of control over action effects was highest following compatible primes, lowest following incompatible primes, and intermediate following neutral primes, in both PCE and NCE conditions. ANOVA did not reveal any main effect of prime–target relation (F(2,22)=0.66, p =0.52). There was a trend towards a main effect of mask–target SOA (F(1,11)=3.09, p =0.10), with PCE trials producing higher control ratings than NCE trials. Importantly, the interaction between SOA and prime–target relation was far from significance, as in Experiment 1 (F(2,22)=0.06, p =0.93) (Fig. 4, lower panel). For comparability with the RT analysis, we also performed post-hoc tests comparing control ratings between compatible and incompatible trials for PCE and NCE trials, and found significant differences in both conditions (PCE: p =0.014, NCE p =0.029). We also compared control ratings between neutral and compatible trials in PCE (p =0.33) and NCE (p =0.63) conditions, and between neutral and incompatible trials in PCE (p =0.11) and NCE (p =0.076) trials as well. In summary, on both PCE and NCE trials, participants experienced higher levels of control over action effects following compatible prime–target associations – consistently with the pattern of ratings found in Experiment 1. Interestingly, compatible priming did not significantly boost sense of control compared to neutral priming. However, participants tended to feel less control when incompatibly vs. neutrally-primed on both PCE and NCE conditions. In addition, we again found a main effect of action-effect interval (F(2,22)=42.55, p <0.001). Post-hoc testing showed that participants experienced strongest sense of control with 100ms response-effect intervals, less control with 300ms, and least control with 500ms. All pairwise comparisons were significant (p <0.001). Importantly, there was no significant interaction between action-effect interval and prime–target relation (F(4,44)=1.49, p =0.22): as in Experiment 1, predictability of the effect did not differently influence sense of control across compatible and incompatible and neutral trials. The interaction between action-effect interval and SOA was not significant (F(2,22)=0.48, p =0.62) nor was the three-way interaction between all the factors (F(4,44)=0.94, p =0.44). 3.2.4 Prime-discrimination results Detection analyses confirmed that primes were below the threshold of awareness, with mean d′ not significantly different from zero (PCE, mean d′=0.037±0.14, p =0.38; NCE, mean d′=−0.043±0.13, p =0.29) and no d′ greater than two standard deviations above the mean. Note that these results are consistent with d′ analyses performed in two previous studies using the same stimuli and procedure (Chambon, Wenke, Fleming, Prinz, & Haggard, 2012; Wenke et al., 2010). To ensure that even slight individual variations in prime discrimination could not account for variations in participants’ sense of control, we also used linear regressions to explore whether individual participants’ d′ values could be related to their control ratings in compatible and incompatible trials of the PCE/NCE experiment. These analyses did not reveal any significant association, either on compatible (PCE: R = −0.26, p = 0.41; NCE: R = −0.38, p = 0.21) or incompatible trials (PCE: R = 0.06, p = 0.84; NCE: R = −0.14, p = 0.64) (Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, the sign of the regression coefficients in fact indicated that participants with better prime discrimination felt less sense of control. Therefore, prime discrimination performance seems unlikely to explain why participants feel more control in compatible, relative to incompatible, trials. 4 Discussion Previous evidence suggested that a subjective sense of agency arises when external events occur in close association with an action that people perform, or simply intend to perform (Blakemore et al., 1998; Farrer et al., 2008; Moore & Haggard, 2008; Sato, 2009; Wegner, Sparrow, & Winerman, 2004). Most models conclude from this evidence that agency is inferred retrospectively, after an action, on the basis of its external consequences. Our results extend these views in two important ways. First, across two experiments, we showed that sense of agency is also informed by early signals generated at the moment of action selection. Importantly, these signals were not related to anticipation of the effects of action, because the colour-patch action effects in our experiment were equally predictable across compatible and incompatible priming conditions. Specifically, the colour was independent of the direction indicated by both the subliminal prime and the target arrow, but depended only on the compatibility relation between the prime and the subsequent target. Thus, the stronger experience of control when prime and target were compatible could not be explained by the prime directly predicting the effect. Rather it could only be explained by the fluency of action selection processing, as manipulated by our prime–target relation. Thus, sense of control depends on action selection signals generated in advance of the action itself, and before action outcomes are known (see also Wenke et al., 2010). In Experiment 2, we included neutral primes. These produced control ratings intermediate between those for compatible primes and incompatible primes (though not statistically different from either in this small, follow-up experiment). While caution is required in interpreting statistically null results, the intermediate ratings obtained with neutral primes suggests that the prospective component of agency involves both an experienced control benefit for action selection fluency, and a control cost for action selection dysfluency. Further, adequately-powered studies might usefully assess which of these influences is stronger. 1 The effects reported here could also be interpreted in terms of access to action representations, rather than processing fluency. On this view, compatible primes would increase the «mental accessibility» of the response, through increasing the ease with which the representation of the response can be activated by the target (Eitam & Higgins, 2010). Easier access might then be experienced as greater control over outcomes following that particular response. This explanation is not incompatible with the fluency account, and indeed it is difficult to choose between them on the basis of the present data. 1 We further show that effects of action fluency on subjective control are prospective – i.e., arise during the processes that select and generate action – and cannot be due to participants retrospectively monitoring their own motor performance. We used the NCE effect to reverse the normal relationship between prime–target compatibility and RTs, but found that subjective control remained unaffected, in two separate experiments. Thus, in compatible NCE trials, participants experienced stronger control despite slower response times and higher error rates, while in incompatible NCE trials they experienced less control despite faster RTs. Although studies using other tasks show that people can monitor RTs to estimate their performance (Corallo et al., 2008; Marti et al., 2010), our results suggest that the prospective aspect of control does not depend on such performance monitoring. The NCE is normally considered the result of an automatic, inhibitory, mechanism within the brain’s action programming centres (Schlaghecken, Bowman, & Eimer, 2006; Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2002, 2006). This auto-inhibition occurs when no additional evidence – such as a congruent target – provides follow-up confirmation of the initial activation elicited by the prime (see Schlaghecken et al. (2007) for a review). Interestingly, this model of premotor processing posits a strict serial order of evidence accumulation, allowing us to localise the prospective signals for sense of control within the processing chain. Clearly, the initial prime-induced activation of motor intentions that causes the PCE must precede the subsequent window of follow-up confirmation that causes the NCE (Schlaghecken et al., 2007) (see Fig. 6a, upper panel). Our data shows that sense of control depends on initial prime-induced activation of motor intentions, but is unaffected by whether follow-up confirmation occurs (as in PCE) or not (as in NCE). Therefore, sense of control must depend on signals generated before the stage of the auto-inhibition process thought to underlie the NCE. Our data also allow a second comment on serial processing underlying the sense of control. We showed that prime–target compatibility and response-effect interval both had strong effects on sense of control, but that these effects were strictly additive, with no convincing interaction between them (F <1). By the additive factors logic (Sternberg, 1969), prime compatibility and response-effect intervals should therefore influence different stages in the processes that generate sense of control. The influence of response-effect intervals must, necessarily, be retrospective, because interval duration is known only once the colour effect terminates the interval. Similarly, the influence of prime compatibility must necessarily be prospective, because prime compatibility was statistically independent of action and colour effect in our design. Thus, while the absence of interaction must be interpreted with caution appropriate for a null result, clear additivity of these two factors is consistent with a dissociation between prospective and retrospective contributions to sense of control. We suggest that the experience of control in normal circumstances represents a sum of these two independent components. Together, our results suggest action selection processes contribute prospectively to the sense of control. This view is compatible with a number of models of action selection. In one influential model, action selection involves a hierarchical process of generating intentions which increase in specificity (Pacherie, 2000, 2008; see also Chambon et al., 2011). In our case, primes provide a first specification of which keypress to perform. When the subsequent target is compatible, the process of specifying the intention is fluent and facilitated, relative to incompatible conditions. Alternatively, other recent models treat intention as parallel competition between alternative premotor representations (Cisek, 2007). In such models, strength of an intention depends on how much its activation level exceeds that of alternatives. Compatible primes might increase sense of control in our task either by facilitating the processes that develop intentions, or by boosting the final activation level of an intention, or both. Importantly, however, in both models, the sense of control depends on processes that occur before action initiation, and makes no reference to the effects of action. In this sense, feeling of control is partly prospective, rather than effect-related. We propose a model of prospective sense of control that captures these constraints. Once an intentional code for left or right action has been fully specified by the subliminal prime, it is transferred to temporary storage in an “intentional buffer” (Fig. 6b). Importantly, this intentional buffer is not altered by the subsequent process of confirmation, or by the auto-inhibition that occurs in the NCE. We suggest that the prospective contribution of action selection to sense of control arises from merely reading out the intentional buffer, in advance of the action itself and before the moment where NCE operates. Under normal circumstances, the prospective feeling of control read from the buffer would be rapidly followed by the resulting action and the predicted effect. Only once action and effect have occurred, can the classic mechanisms of action-effect comparison begin. These mechanisms involve additional retrospective processes. For example, the contents of the intentional buffer may be compared with the action and its external effect, resulting in the subject not feeling responsible for the effect when a mismatch occurs (e.g., Farrer et al., 2008; Sato & Yasuda, 2005). Although this is necessarily speculative, there is convergent evidence suggesting the existence of such a buffer. Computational models of motor control as applied to sense of agency have demonstrated that computing agency requires matching forward model predictions with sensory feedback (e.g., Blakemore, Frith, & Wolpert, 2001). The predictions are available instantaneously, but the sensory feedback is delayed. Because of this delay, the predictions made by the forward model must be buffered until the feedback becomes available, ensuring that the matching process uses the correct temporal alignment. This buffer component was very explicit in earlier versions of these models (e.g., Miall, Weir, Wolpert, & Stein, 1993), though it receives less attention in more recent incarnations. In our suggestion, it is not the outcome prediction of the forward model that is buffered, but the processing of action selection itself (i.e., the so-called “inverse model”). However, our suggestion of buffering premotor signals is essentially similar. Interestingly, the prospective contribution of selection fluency to sense of control in our experiment is strictly illusory. The relation between participant’s actual behaviour and subsequent outcomes was the same whether primes were compatible or not. Therefore, compatible and incompatible conditions did not differ in the level of actual control, in the statistical sense that action-outcome contingency was similar for compatible and incompatible conditions. Yet, when subjects were asked to explicitly elaborate on how they judged control during post-experiment debriefing, none of them mentioned the fluency, or ease of compatibly-primed actions. Rather, most participants reported trying to focus on the colour of effects or on action-effect intervals, and occasionally reported “magical thoughts” (e.g., “I though the harder I pressed the button response, the more in control I was of when the colour patch appeared”). Internal signals of premotor fluency might not produce a strong conscious experience with distinctive content, but might influence the experience of surrounding events. Thus, fluency of action selection would not be experienced as such, but would presumably be experienced as something that goes ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ in the control of instrumental action, and thus seems relevant to sense of agency. However, the fact that the experience of fluent selection cannot be explicitly reported or experienced, does not prevent the brain from using fluency signals to form an experience of agency (Chambon et al., 2012). In that sense, signals relating to the fluency of action selection would not be perceived for what they really are, but (mis-)attributed to the processes of actually controlling the action. The large literature on sense of agency confirms that multiple cues, including statistical contingency (Moore, Lagnado, Deal, & Haggard, 2009), temporal contiguity (Farrer et al., 2008), and prior expectation (Wegner, 2002) all contribute to sense of agency. But people seem to have relatively little explicit knowledge of how they compute agency, suggesting that this multiple cue integration process is largely automatic. Fluency signals arising from action selection processes may combine, at an implicit level, with several others cues, to produce a reliable sense of agency. In routine situations, for example, fluent action selection and control of action effects generally co-occur. Thus, the skilled pilot immediately knows which button in a complex cockpit must be pressed to deal with each specific type of incident: her extensive training means that she automatically plans a specific response appropriate to the current situation, and knows that the aircraft will respond appropriately. Outside the laboratory, fluent action selection is often a good advance predictor of actual statistical control over the external environment. By separating fluency of action selection from actual control contingencies, we have demonstrated the importance of this prospective aspect of agency. In future research, we will investigate whether this prospective aspect of agency is overwritten when we actually lose control, for example if the actual outcome of our action is not as predicted. We expect that the healthy brain successfully integrates prospective feelings of control based on action selection, and retrospective judgements of actual control over action outcomes. However, this integration process may fail in some circumstances, as it might be the case in psychiatric patients suffering from delusions of control.

In a new cooking show on television, a group of four chefs are charged with the task of preparing a meal in a certain culinary style. A meal is composed of two starters, one main dish and a dessert. The show panel judges each of the four dishes, and determines whether it is successful or not. The group wins the task if the meal is successful, i.e. • At least one starter is successful • The main dish is successful • The dessert is successful In other words, if there is a successful starter, a successful main dish, and a successful dessert, then the group wins even if one starter has failed. But if the main dish has failed or the dessert has failed, then the group has failed the task regardless of the success of the other dishes. The four chefs Oren, Benni, Gidi and Doron participate in one of the shows. After receiving their task, they decided to split the preparation between them so that each chef prepares one of the four dishes. The chefs did not agree on who will prepare which dish, so they decided to determine it by chance. It turned out that Oren prepares a starter, Benni prepares a starter, Gidi prepares the main dish, and Doron prepares the dessert 1. How much responsibility, do you think, does each of the chefs have for the success or failure of the task? 2. The show panel has tried the dishes and determined that none of the dishes was successful. Therefore the group has failed the task. To what extent, do you think, is each of the group members to blame for the group’s failure? 3. To what extent, do you think, would each of the group members be to blame had it been determined that Gidi’s main dish was successful, whereas the other three dishes were not? 4. To what extent, do you think, would each of the group members be to blame had it been determined that Benni’s starter was successful, whereas the other three dishes were not?

Abstract Attributions of responsibility play a critical role in many group interactions. This paper explores the role of causal and counterfactual reasoning in blame attributions in groups. We develop a general framework that builds on the notion of pivotality: an agent is pivotal if she could have changed the group outcome by acting differently. In three experiments we test successive refinements of this notion – whether an agent is pivotal in close possible situations and the number of paths to achieve pivotality. In order to discriminate between potential models, we introduced group tasks with asymmetric structures. Some group members were complements (for the two to contribute to the group outcome it was necessary that both succeed) whereas others were substitutes (for the two to contribute to the group outcome it was sufficient that one succeeds). Across all three experiments we found that people’s attributions were sensitive to the number of paths to pivotality. In particular, an agent incurred more blame for a team loss in the presence of a successful complementary peer than in the presence of a successful substitute. Keywords Responsibility Attribution Counterfactuals Causality Groups We have come to think of the actual as one among many possible worlds. We need to repaint that picture. All possible worlds lie within the actual one.(Goodman, 1983, p. 57) 1 Introduction Your football team has just lost an important match after the goalkeeper failed to save an easy shot. How much is the goalkeeper to blame for the team’s loss? Does it matter that the final score was 0–2, so that the goal in question did not affect the outcome of the match? Is the goalkeeper’s blame moderated by the fact that the forward in your team missed a penalty kick? Would it make a difference if you could know that the penalty kick would have been saved by the other team’s goalkeeper anyway? Team sports is a commonplace context in which blame (and credit) is attributed to individuals for their team’s outcome. Such attributions are also prevalent and carry serious implications in contexts as diverse as business and criminal law (e.g., Hart, 2008). The potential importance of responsibility attributions in general has lead to the development of a substantial literature looking at the psychological processes behind responsibility attributions (Alicke, 2000; Lagnado & Channon, 2008; Shaver, 1985; Weiner, 1995). Nonetheless, little research has been conducted on responsibility attributions in team environments. Specifically, we do not yet have a good understanding of how the performance of one team member moderates the responsibility of her partners. In this paper we consider different ways to model responsibility attributions in a simple team environment. We identify behavioral principles revealed in three experiments designed to distinguish between the different models and develop a new model, which extends the structural model proposed by Chockler and Halpern (2004) and studied by Gerstenberg and Lagnado (2010) to capture these principles. According to Chockler and Halpern’s structural model, there is a close relationship between causality, counterfactuals and attributions of responsibility (see also Petrocelli, Percy, Sherman, & Tormala, 2011). An individual is deemed responsible if she was pivotal in the actual situation, whereby pivotal means that the (team) outcome counterfactually depends on her action. Hence, a person is pivotal for a loss if she would have made the team win had she performed better and, conversely, a person is pivotal for a win if she would have made the team lose had she performed worse. While the intuition is strong that a person carries responsibility in a situation in which she would have made a difference to the outcome, it is less clear whether a person can be held responsible in a situation in which she would not have changed the outcome. According to a simple pivotality model the answer is negative: someone cannot be responsible for an outcome that would have occurred irrespective of their action (see below). Chockler and Halpern (2004), however, propose that responsibility comes in degrees. Responsibility attributions are determined by the number of changes that are required to be made in the actual situation in order to create a counterfactual situation in which the target individual would have been pivotal for the team outcome. For example, the forward in the opening example is not pivotal; had he scored the penalty shot, the team would still have lost the match. Nevertheless, he would have been pivotal in the counterfactual situation in which the other team scored only one goal. The model takes this observation into account, and attributes the forward partial responsibility for the loss. Hence, a person’s responsibility is not only determined by whether her contribution made a difference in the actual situation but also by whether her contribution would have made a difference in other possible situations. In general, a person’s responsibility decreases with the number of changes that would be necessary to make her pivotal vis-á-vis the outcome. Initial validation for the use of causal models and counterfactual considerations in responsibility attributions in team environments was provided by Gerstenberg and Lagnado (2010). In their experiment, participants form a team with three virtual players. Each player performs an individual task and the team’s outcome (win or loss) is determined as a function of the individual outcomes. The participants are then asked to attribute either credit for a team win or blame for a team loss to each of the players. 1 Chockler and Halpern (2004) distinguish between responsibility and blame. Blame is defined as anticipated responsibility and thus relative to the epistemic state of the agent. However, since we do not vary epistemic states in our experiments, we will follow Gerstenberg and Lagnado (2010) in equating blame with negative responsibility (see Robbennolt, 2000, for a discussion of the different response measures). 1 Gerstenberg and Lagnado (2010) varied the way in which individual scores were combined to determine the team score. In the sum condition, individual scores combined additively. In the min condition, the team’s performance equalled the performance of the weakest player. Finally, in the max condition the best player in the team determined the team’s outcome. Importantly, these different causal structures have implications about the situations in which players are pivotal and how many changes would be required to render them pivotal. Gerstenberg and Lagnado (2010) found that the observed attributions were strongly correlated with the predictions of Chockler and Halpern’s (2004) model. Nevertheless, the way in which the experiment was designed leaves room for alternative explanations. The players’ roles in the different team games that were used were always identical. For example, Chockler and Halpern’s (2004) model predicts that responsibility attributions to each individual group member in the min condition decrease with the number of players who failed their task. If only one player failed, he is pivotal for the loss and hence fully responsible. However, for each additional player who failed in their task, one change would be required to render the target player pivotal and responsibility attributions are predicted to decrease accordingly. This prediction coincides with the predictions of two other, non-causal explanations. First, the principle of diffusion of responsibility (Darley & Latane, 1968; Wallach, Kogan, & Bem, 1964) dictates that an individual’s responsibility decreases the more people she shared it with, independent of the exact causal structure of the situation. Second, as all team members perform the same task, their performance is indicative of the task difficulty. Thus, the observed pattern can arise from a simple principle stating that one incurs less blame for failing in a difficult task compared to an easy task. Once again, the causal structure plays no role in the responsibility attributions, as responsibility is determined according to relative performance. Our experiments are specifically designed to create causally asymmetric team structures in order to ascertain the roles of causal structure and counterfactual thinking in responsibility attributions, and to disentangle the alternative explanations described above. The experiments present participants with a scenario in which a team has lost its challenge and ask for attributions of blame to the team members, given their individual contributions to the team outcome. The experimental paradigm is designed to focus on the issues at hand, abstracting from additional features that are important in many natural examples. In particular, we exclude any elements that distinguish blame from the more general construct of responsibility such as epistemic states and intentions (Chockler & Halpern, 2004). In the next section, we present the general framework and four models of responsibility before proceeding to describe the experiments. 2 Theoretical analysis For simplicity, we restrict our attention to team challenges in which individuals perform independent tasks and both the individual and team outcomes are binary. We consider a team with n agents, each performing an individual task. The outcome of agent i is denoted by o i ∈{0, 1}, with 0=failure and 1=success. The team outcome t is determined by a team function t = f(o 1, o 2,…, o n )∈{0, 1}, with 0=loss and 1=win. The function f is weakly increasing in o i , i.e., the team outcome cannot benefit from a failure of a team member, and similarly cannot be harmed by any of the team members succeeding. As we show in the following, this basic framework is rich enough to capture the principles of simple causality, counterfactual causality, and diffusion of responsibility. We consider several models that differ in how they take into account peer performance and causal relationships when assigning responsibility to any one team member. 2.1 Simple responsibility (SimResp) As a benchmark we consider a model, which ignores both peer performance and the causal structure. The model simply assigns a responsibility of 1 if the individual and team outcome are aligned, and 0 otherwise. In other words, if the team lost, then all the team members who have failed their individual task receive blame, and if the team won, all the team members who have succeeded receive credit. 2.2 Diffusion of responsibility (DiffResp) The diffusion of responsibility model also ignores the causal relationships but takes into account peer performance as it divides the responsibility equally between all individuals who are assigned full responsibility by SimResp. The model can be interpreted as a normalized version of SimResp, in which the total responsibility sums up to exactly 1. 2.3 Simple pivotality (SimPiv) The simple pivotality model refines SimResp by imposing a further condition on responsibility, namely, the model assigns a responsibility of 1 if and only if the individual and team outcomes are aligned and the individual is pivotal. That is, blame is only assigned to team members who failed but could have made their team win had they succeeded, given the performance of their peers. 2.4 Counterfactual pivotality (CFPiv) The counterfactual pivotality model is equivalent to Gerstenberg and Lagnado’s (2010) structural model, which is derived from Chockler and Halpern’s (2004) general model of responsibility. Similar to SimPiv, CFPiv assigns a responsibility of 1 to individuals who are pivotal. The two models differ with regard to individuals who are not pivotal, but whose outcome is aligned with their team’s outcome. In this case, the individual can be made pivotal by considering a counterfactual situation in which the individual outcomes (success/fail) of the other team members are changed. Let N be the number of the changes required to make the target player pivotal. 2 Chockler and Halpern (2004) define N in terms of the number of variables in the causal model whose value needs to be changed. It would of course also be possible to consider changes to the causal model, for example by changing the team function f. However, while there are many possible ways in which the causal model could be changed, the notion of change in terms of the number of variables is well-defined. Hence, to allow for a clear test of the model, we restrict our analysis to the simple and intuitive changes to variables within a given causal model. 2 The CFPiv responsibility is defined to be 1/(N +1). Consider, for example, the hypothetical case where two of the authors find the same mistake in this paper. Since the mistake would have been corrected if only one of us found it, none of us was pivotal for eliminating the mistake. However, each could become pivotal through making one change to the actual situation, namely if the other had not detected the mistake. The CFPiv model therefore assigns responsibility of 1/(1+1)=0.5 to each author. 3 Note that counterfactual reasoning is already required to ascertain actual (simple) pivotality. Counterfactual pivotality thus involves two levels of counterfactual reasoning – thinking about counterfactual worlds in which the outcome could be counterfactually altered by the individual. 3 3 Experiment 1 The three models we compare to the benchmark SimResp all take into account peer performance when attributing responsibility to any team member. However, the models differ in the exact way they achieve this. As mentioned in the introduction, when the team members are symmetric with regard to their effect on the team outcome, the three models make similar qualitative predictions. To see this, consider a situation with three team members, Alice, Bob and Chuck. The causal structure is such that each team member has to succeed in their individual task in order for the team to win their challenge, that is, t = min(o Alice , o Bob , o Chuck ). How much blame would Alice be predicted to receive in a situation in which all three failed compared to a situation in which Bob succeeded in his task? According to DiffResp, Alice receives more blame in the latter case (1/2 compared to 1/3), as the total blame is shared by fewer people. According to SimPiv, Alice would not receive any blame in either situation because she is neither pivotal in the situation in which all players failed nor when Bob succeed. Finally, CFPiv predicts that Alice’s blame increases the fewer changes are necessary to render her pivotal. In fact, it makes the same predictions as DiffResp. In the situation in which all failed, two changes are necessary to render Alice pivotal (i.e. changing o Bob and o Chuck from 0 to 1). In the situation in which Bob succeeded only one change is required (i.e. changing o Chuck from 0 to 1). Hence, N =2 in the former and N =1 in the latter situation and Alice’s blame is predicted to increase from 1/3 to 1/2. We see that, in order to make a sharp distinction between the predictions of the different models, an asymmetric structure is required. More specifically, we wish to test the qualitative prediction of the CFPiv model that the effect of one team member’s success on the blame attributed to another team member depends on the relationship between the two. If the two are substitutes, such that the success of one of them makes the success of the other unnecessary for the team winning, each team member must fail in order for the other to be pivotal, t = max(o 1, o 2). Therefore the success of one reduces the blame assigned to the other. Conversely, if the two team members are complementary, so that in order for one to be pivotal the other must succeed, the success of one increases the blame assigned to the other, t = min(o 1, o 2). The team challenge we employ in Experiments 1 and 2 includes four players. Player A is our target player, and is a substitute of player B and complementary to player C. In line with the analysis above, we manipulate the individual outcomes of B and C, and measure the blame assigned to player A. To these three players we add a fourth team member, D, who must succeed in order for the team to win. The role of player D is to make it possible to manipulate the individual outcomes of players B and C without making A pivotal as a result. Hence, the causal structure is defined by the team function t = min(max(o A , o B ), o C , o D ). Fig. 1 shows a graphical representation of the team challenge. We compare the blame attributed to A in three within-subjects conditions. We test whether A’s blame changes when either only B or only C succeeds, compared to a baseline in which all four team members fail. Both SimResp and SimPiv predict no change in the blame attributed to A between the three conditions. SimResp always predicts that A will be blamed and SimPiv that A will not be blamed. Diffusion of responsibility predicts that A’s blame will be reduced by the same amount compared to the baseline independent of whether B or C succeeded. CFPiv is the only model predicting a difference between the two conditions in which one team member succeeds. The blame assigned to A should decrease with the success of his substitute B, and increase with the success of his complement C. Fig. 2 summarizes the predictions by the different models. 3.1 Method 3.1.1 Participants Eighty-three education undergraduate students from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem were recruited at the end of class and participated for course credit. 3.1.2 Materials and procedure All participants received identical forms that included the scenario depicted in Table 1 . 4 The original Hebrew version is available upon request. Demos of Experiments 2 and 3 can be accessed here: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/experiments/demos/finding_fault/finding_fault.html. 4 Each question was followed by four 7-points Likert scales. Each scale was labeled by a name (‘Oren’, ‘Benni’, ‘Gidi’, and ‘Doron’), with the end points of the scales labeled as ‘not at all’ and ‘very much’. Question 1 was presented below the scenario, whereas Questions 2–4 were presented on the back of the page with their order counterbalanced between participants. Since no effect was found for the order of presentation the responses were aggregated across orders. Participants were instructed to respond to Question 1 before turning the page and not to change their response after reading the subsequent questions. 5 Question 1 was included as part of a separate research program, and is not analyzed in the current paper. 5 3.2 Results and discussion The blame attributions obtained for Questions 2–4 are presented in Fig. 3 . In order to test whether participants’ blame attributions differed between the players and situations, we conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA with Player (A, B, C and D) and Situation (all failed, B succeeded, C succeeded) as within-subjects factors. We found main effects of Player, F(3, 204)=63.60, p <.001, partial η 2 =.483 and of Situation, F(2, 136)=60.63, p <.001, partial η 2 =.471 as well as an interaction effect, F(6, 408)=76.34, p <.001, partial η 2 =.529. Having established that participants’ blame attributions were influenced by our experimental manipulation, we proceed with a series of pairwise t-tests to test the more specific comparisons for which the models discussed above make different predictions. 6 Somewhat surprisingly, the average blame attributed to players who succeeded in their individual tasks was higher than the minimal possible value of 1. We attribute this result to a number of unmotivated participants who provided random responses (e.g., marking the same value throughout the form). This behavior is close to absent in the better-controlled Experiment 2, which replicates all the qualitative results of the current experiment. 6 The blame attributed to A is affected by the individual outcomes of the other team members. Compared to the baseline when all team members fail, blame is decreased when B succeeds (5.55 vs. 4.46, t (81) =4.288, p <.001), thereby rejecting SimResp and SimPiv. Furthermore, the blame attributions depend not only on the number of team members who share the blame, but also on the causal relationships between them. A’s blame is higher when C succeeds compared to when B succeeds (5.43 vs. 4.46, t (82) =3.910, p <.001), thereby rejecting DiffResp. The best prediction is provided by CFPiv, although A’s blame does not increase when C succeeds compared to when all four fail, contrary to the prediction of the model (5.43 vs. 5.55, t (81) =−.709, p =.480). Another prediction of CFPiv not supported by the data is that all team members should receive the same blame when all fail. The minimal number of changes required for pivotality is identical (N =2) for each player. For example, in order to render A pivotal, a counterfactual situation needs to be considered in which the values of C and D were changed from 0 to 1. Similarly, in order to render C pivotal, the values of A (or B) and D would need to be changed. However, players C and D, whose respective successes are necessary for a team win, are assigned more blame than players A and B (F (3,79) =4.981, p <.005). Furthermore, when C succeeds, D still receives more blame than A and B (6.09 vs. 5.43, t (80) =3.141, p <.005 and 5.44, t (79) =3.336, p <.005, respectively). 4 Experiment 2 In contrast to the prediction of the CFPiv model, the blame assigned to A did not increase as the number of changes required to achieve the counterfactual situation in which A is pivotal decreased. To see whether blame does increase in the extreme case in which the required number of changes is reduced to zero, we added a new situation to Experiment 2, in which both C and D succeeded in their individual tasks, thereby making A pivotal in the observed outcome. Additionally, we designed Experiment 2 to test the robustness of the results of Experiment 1 by repeating the same team challenge structure in a different framing, using computer interface, and with a different participant population. 4.1 Method 4.1.1 Participants Sixty-one psychology undergraduate students at University College London participated in the experiment as part of a lab exercise. 4.1.2 Materials and procedure We presented participants with the dot-clicking game, in which a dot is randomly repositioned on a computer screen each time the player clicks on it. The score in the game is defined to be the number of clicks made within an fixed duration of time. In the experiment, hypothetical players in a team play the dot-clicking game. Each player succeeds in her game if she obtains a given minimal score. The team outcome is determined by a combination of the individual outcomes, which was presented graphically to the participants as in Fig. 1. The structure of the game is equivalent to that used in Experiment 1. At the beginning of the experiment, participants played the dot-clicking game themselves to get a sense for the task. To avoid participants forming expectations based on their own performance, we stated that the game played by the hypothetical players was played for a different duration with a different-sized dot. The first stage of the experiment was part of a separate study, and involved the participants making criticality attributions to players in different team challenges before the challenges are played. In the second stage of the experiment, participants used on-screen sliders to assign blame to the four players in the team challenge presented in Fig. 1, in response to the following question: “How blameworthy is each player for the team’s loss in this challenge?” The sliders corresponded to 11-point Likert scales (0=‘not at all’, 10=‘very much’). The four different outcome patterns were presented in random order. 4.2 Results and discussion The blame attributions are presented in Fig. 4 . As in Experiment 1, a repeated-measures ANOVA with Player and Situation as within-subject factors revealed significant main effects of Player, F(3, 180)=32.69, p <.001, partial η 2 =.353 and of Situation, F(3, 180)=58.58, p <.001, partial η 2 =.494 as well as an interaction effect, F(9, 540)=231.60, p <.001, partial η 2 =.794. The patterns of blame attributions fully replicate those observed in Experiment 1. Compared to the baseline condition in which all players failed, the blame attributed to A significantly decreases when her substitute B succeeds (3.69 vs. 5.75, t (60) =4.972, p <.001), but does not significantly change when her complement C succeeds (6.00 vs. 5.75, t (60) =1.023, p =.310). However, when both complementary players C and D succeed, so that A becomes pivotal, A incurs significantly more blame (6.95 vs. 5.75, t (60) =3.687, p <.001). As in Experiment 1, if all four team members have failed their individual tasks, then players C and D are perceived as more to blame than A and B (F (3,180) =18.435, p <.001). Similarly, D is assigned more blame than both A and B when only C succeeds (7.07 vs. 6.00, t (60) =2.833, p =.006 for either comparison). Taken together, the results of the two experiments establish that blame attributions made by our participants are sensitive to the causal structure. The highest blame is assigned to an agent in the situation in which she was pivotal, and the lowest blame is assigned when the most changes of individual outcomes are required in order to make the agent counterfactually pivotal. In contrast with diffusion of responsibility considerations, reducing the number of agents who share the blame has different effects when different agents’ outcomes are changed, and can even reduce the blame, depending on the causal structure and the relationship between the players. Thus, out of the four models we consider, the model of counterfactual pivotality provides the best explanation of the blame attributions observed in the experiments so far. However, several findings remain unexplained by the model. In both experiments, the success of player C was not sufficient to increase the blame attributed to A, as predicted by the model, although the predicted effect was obtained in Experiment 2 when both C and D have succeeded. None of the theoretical considerations can explain the lack of effect in the former case, as it is predicted by both the CFPiv and DiffResp models. More interesting is the systematic difference in blame between players A and B on one hand and C and D on the other hand within the same situation, when the minimal number of changes required to make an agent pivotal is the same for all those who failed in their individual task. We conjecture that this result is explained by the following observation. In the situation in which all of the team members have failed, the minimal change required to make each of them pivotal involves changing the outcomes of two other members. However, there is only one way to achieve this for team members A and B, namely by counterfactually changing the individual outcomes of C and D. In contrast, there are two ways to make each of C and D counterfactually pivotal, namely by changing the outcome of the other one as well as that of either A or B. For example, to make D counterfactually pivotal one must change C as well as either A or B. The same rationale holds for the situation in which only C succeeded. In this case, to make D counterfactually pivotal one must change either A or B, whereas to make A counterfactually pivotal one must change D. This explanation implies that a minimal change model does not reflect the way in which people make responsibility attributions. Rather, when multiple paths exist in which an agent can be made counterfactually pivotal, blame increases accordingly. In the following sections we outline a model that expands the model based on Chockler and Halpern (2004) to include this insight and test the new model in a new experiment. 5 Multiple counterfactual pivotality Consider the following situation: You are the manager of your home country’s team in the International Salsa Competition. Your team consists of Alice, Bob, Chuck and Dan. In order to compete in the tournament, Alice will need to show up and at least one of her partners. You instruct all of them to come to the tournament. However, as it turns out, none of them show up on the day of the competition. How much would you blame Alice for the fact that your team could not compete? How much would you blame Bob, Chuck or Dan? The CFPiv model predicts that all of them will be blamed equally. Given that none of them showed up, a minimum of one change needs to be made in order to render Alice pivotal. We can either change Bob, Chuck or Dan from not having showed up to having showed up. Similarly, for Bob, only one change is needed to render him pivotal, namely changing Alice to having showed up. The same holds of course for Chuck and Dan. Hence, we see that all team members are predicted to receive equal blame. However, the intuition is strong that Alice carries more blame for the fact that the team could not compete than each of her partners, as there are more counterfactual situations in which her appearance is crucial for the team to compete. In this section, we introduce a new model, which we term multiple counterfactual pivotality (MultCFPiv). The new model expands CFPiv to account for the results of Experiments 1 and 2. Recall that the CFPiv model assigns responsibility according to the minimal change required to attain pivotality. Our new model retains the principle of counterfactual pivotality, but allows for multiple counterfactual situations, in which an agent is pivotal, to be considered. The new model has three important features. First, adding new paths by which an agent can become pivotal increases her responsibility. Second, as in the CFPiv model, responsibility decreases with the number of changes required to attain pivotality along any single path. Lastly, the new model reduces to the CFPiv model if there is only one way in which the agent can become counterfactually pivotal. In order to accommodate multiple paths to pivotality while maintaining the general framework specified by the CFPiv model, we define an equivalent single path for any situation in which multiple paths exist. A path in this context is simply defined as a series of changes to the individual outcomes of other team members required to turn the observed situation into a counterfactual situation in which the target agent is pivotal. The responsibility assigned to the agent in the multiple-paths situation is the same as that assigned by the CFPiv model with the equivalent single path. The number of changes, N, is defined to be 0 if the agent is already pivotal and otherwise (1) N = 1 ∑ i = 1 k 1 n i , where k is the number of different paths by which the agent can become pivotal, with required number of changes n 1, n 2,…, n k , respectively. The responsibility can then be defined to be 1/(N +1), as in the original CFPiv model. 7 This definition relies on the harmonic mean of the number of changes, and mirrors similar equivalencies in physical systems such as hydraulics and electricity. For example, it is isomorphic to the resistance in an electric circuit, in which each change is represented by a resistor of 1Ω, and resistors are connected serially to represent the number of changes along a path, and in parallel to represent multiple paths. We thank Yaniv Edery for suggesting this analogy. 7 It remains to define how the number and lengths of the multiple paths are determined based on the causal structure of the team challenge and the individual players’ outcomes. The first step is to identify all of the counterfactual outcome profiles in which an agent would be pivotal, and to determine the differences between each such counterfactual situation and the actually observed situation. Note that ordering the sequences sequentially defines a series of changes, or a path, that turns the actual situation into the counterfactual one. Next, exclude the situations for which the target agent is pivotal at an earlier step along one or more paths. In other words, a counterfactual situation is excluded if one of the changes made in order to attain it can be undone without eliminating pivotality. For each of the k remaining counterfactual situations, the minimal change (shortest path) is entered into the responsibility attribution. To illustrate, consider the team challenge in Fig. 1. As noted earlier in the discussion of our experimental results, if all four team members have failed their individual tasks, it is possible to make any of them pivotal through two counterfactual changes. Accordingly, the blame assigned to any team member according to CFPiv is 1/(2+1)=1/3. Nevertheless, for both A and B, there exists exactly one counterfactual situation in which they are pivotal, hence MultCFPiv also assigns them a blame of 1/3. Conversely, for either C or D, there are three counterfactual situations in which they are pivotal. Namely, when the other one succeeds, in addition to either A, B, or both A and B. Since any path to the latter situation (in which both A and B succeeded) must go through one of the first two (in which either A or B succeeded), we exclude it from the analysis. Thus, we end up with two paths by which pivotality can be reached, each involving two changes. The number of changes in the equivalent single path is given by 1 1 2 + 1 2 = 1 . Therefore, the responsibility assigned to C and D by our model is 1/(1+1)=1/2. As a further illustration, consider the team challenge in Fig. 5 , in which the team wins if D succeeds in addition to either C or both A and B, hence t = min(max(o A , o B ), o C )× o D . Once more, assume that all four team members have failed in their individual tasks. In this case, the CFPiv model assigns a blame of 1/3 to A and B and 1/2 to C and D. For example, to make A pivotal we need to change B and D, so N =2, to make D pivotal we need to just change C, so N =1, and to make C pivotal we just need to change D, so N =1. The predictions of MultCFPiv differ only with regard to team member D, who is pivotal in three counterfactual situations, namely when C succeeds, when A and B succeed or when A, B and C succeed. As in the previous example, the model does not consider the latter situation in which all three other team members have succeeded, since a subset of the changes is sufficient for pivotality. There remain two paths to pivotality. One is by changing the outcome of C (n 1 =1), the other is by changing the outcomes of both A and B (n 2 =2). The number of changes in the equivalent single path is now 1 1 1 + 1 2 = 2 3 , and the blame assigned to D is hence 1 / 2 3 + 1 = 0.6 . Experiment 3 tests the novel prediction that team member D incurs more blame than the other three in the team challenge of Fig. 5, in the case that all four team members failed their individual tasks. 6 Experiment 3 To test the novel predictions derived from the MultCFPiv model, we constructed the team challenge depicted in Fig. 5, in which the team wins if D succeeds in addition to either C or both A and B. The new challenge also serves as an additional test of the hypotheses tested in the previous experiments. We argued above that an implication of the CFPiv model is that how much blame a player incurs, reduces with each successful substitute and increases with each successful complement. The new team challenge provides a test for this generalization. In this challenge, player A is complementary to player B, and is a substitute of player C (in the case where B succeeds). As in the previous experiments, we start with a baseline situation in which all team members failed in their individual task, and compare blame attributions to player A when we reduce the number of failed team members. As in the team challenge of Fig. 1, the failure of player D ensures that none of the other players is pivotal. Fig. 6 presents the blame attributions predicted by the CFPiv and MultCFPiv models for each player in each of the experimental conditions. A comparison of the bars in the figure reveals the qualitative predictions tested in the experiments. The basic prediction of both models is tested by comparing the blame assigned to player A in the three conditions, as in the previous experiments. Namely, A receives more blame if B succeeds, but less blame if C succeeds. The two models differ with regard to the blame attributed to player D. The prediction of the MultCFPiv model to be tested is that D is more to blame than C when all fail or B succeeds, although both can become pivotal through only one change. In addition, the success of B reduces the number of changes required to make D pivotal along the longer path, which is ignored in CFPiv, hence only MultCFPiv predicts a higher blame for D as a result. 6.1 Method 6.1.1 Participants Forty participants from the USA, 13 males and 27 females, ages 19–57 (mean 32) were recruited to participate in the experiment via Amazon Mechanical Turk for a flat fee of $1. 6.1.2 Materials and procedure The procedure was similar to that of Experiment 2. The team challenge used was the one depicted in Fig. 5, and the three conditions were (a) all fail, (b) B succeeds, and (c) C succeeds. Participants provided blame attributions on sliders corresponding to 21-point Likert scales. 6.2 Results and discussion Generally, the patterns observed in the previous two experiments were replicated with the new team challenge (see Fig. 7 ). A repeated-measures ANOVA with Player and Situation as within-subject factors revealed significant main effects of Player, F(3, 234)=89.52, p <.001, partial η 2 =.534 and of Situation, F(2, 156)=50.96, p < .001, partial η 2 =.395 as well as an interaction effect, F(6, 468)=62.64, p <.001, partial η 2 =.445. The blame assigned to player A significantly decreases if the substitute player C succeeds (8.13 vs. 13.00, t (39) =4.452, p <.001), but does not significantly differ if the complement player B succeeds (12.08 vs. 13.00, t (39) =−1.045, p =.303). The effect of reducing the number of team members who failed significantly depends on the role of the team member who succeeded in the individual task, as player A receives more blame when B succeeds compared to when C succeeds (12.08 vs. 8.13, t (39) =3.209, p <.005). The new challenge produces new test cases for the MultCFPiv model. In the situations where the CFPiv and MultCFPiv models diverge, the results are in line with MultCFPiv. When all of the four players fail, player D receives more blame than player C (19.25 vs. 15.35, t (39) =4.444, p <.001), who in turn receives more blame than player A (15.35 vs. 13.00, t (39) =3.116, p <.005) or player B (15.35 vs. 13.35, t (39) =2.723, p <.01). Similarly, player D is perceived as more blameworthy than player C when player B succeeds (19.08 vs. 11.87, t (39) =7.232, p <.001). However, the blame attributed to player D does not significantly change across situations, possibly due to a ceiling effect, as the average blame rating is above 19 out of 20 in all three situations. The data yield one surprising result, which is not predicted by any of the models we consider. Player C is assigned less blame when player B succeeds compared to when all of the players fail (11.87 vs. 15.35, t (39) =3.575, p <.001). Note that the relationship between players B and C is one of substitution. Hence the finding, albeit not predicted by MultCFPiv, is consistent with the general principle implied by counterfactual pivotality reasoning which states that responsibility is reduced when a peer succeeds in the case of substitution. In sum, the results of the new experiment are consistent with the results obtained with the previous team challenge. Out of the five models we consider, the model based on multiple counterfactual pivotality best explains the data. Although some differences predicted by the model are not apparent in the data, we take the results to confirm the basic role of counterfactual pivotality in blame attributions. 7 General discussion This paper provides a simple and clear test for possible models designed to capture the way in which people make responsibility attributions in a team environment. The results of three experiments that varied the causal structure of the team environment are broadly in line with a model that considers not only whether the person under consideration was pivotal in the actual situation but also by how close the person was to making a difference in other counterfactual situations. Two general principles follow from counterfactual pivotality reasoning: First, blame attributions to an agent weakly increase with the number of successful peers in the case of complementarity, as the actual situation becomes more similar to one in which the agent is pivotal. Second, blame attributions weakly decrease with the number of successful peers in the case of substitution, as the actual situation becomes less similar to one in which the agent is pivotal. These relationships are apparent in all of our experiments. The effect of a change in one team member’s performance on the blame incurred by her peer strongly depends on the way in which the respective contributions of the two interact with regard to the team outcome, in line with the theoretical predictions. Our results enable us to extend the CFPiv model tested by Gerstenberg and Lagnado (2010). The CFPiv model only takes into account the minimal number of changes along a single path to render the person under consideration pivotal. In contrast, the MultCFPiv model is sensitive to how many paths there are to reach a counterfactual situation in which the person would be pivotal and how many changes to the actual situation would be required along each path. The sensitivity to counterfactual causal reasoning implied by the experimental results can be interpreted in different ways. The number of paths and counterfactual changes at the heart of the model can be taken as mental steps or, alternatively, as reflecting the difficulty of bringing to mind a certain counterfactual state given the actual state. Thus, the model need not be taken as a literal process model, but as a support for the importance of counterfactual causal reasoning in responsibility attributions in group contexts. The new model sheds light on responsibility attributions in a group setting. However, its applicability is more general. A substantial literature has developed over the last decades dealing with the way in which people make social attributions when there are multiple potential causes (Kun & Weiner, 1973; Leddo, Abelson, & Gross, 1984; McClure, Lalljee, Jaspars, & Abelson, 1989; Reeder & Brewer, 1979; Roese & Morris, 1999). This stream of the literature typically focuses on how people interpret a causally-ambiguous situation, often focusing on the relationship between internal causes, such as ability and effort, and external causes, such as task difficulty or luck (Kelley, 1972). Our extension of Chockler and Halpern’s (2004) model, when applied to intra-person causes rather than to group members, has the power to complement this literature by providing a framework for understanding how responsibility is attributed to multiple causes when the causal structure is unambiguous. One novel development of this approach would be to investigate responsibility attributions in situations where a single individual engages in a complex task with various subcomponents. For example, when a solo athlete competes in a multi-event game such as a decathlon, or when a chef must prepare all dishes himself. The team environment studied in this paper was designed to capture the essentials of responsibility attributions in groups, and abstracts from many real-world features of team performance. We see several directions for future research to pursue in order to take into account important variables that are absent in our framework. In terms of the task structure, the current model is somewhat restricted by the dichotomous individual and team outcomes and deterministic integration function. Future models should be developed to account for probabilistic structures. These can include probabilistic processes at the level of performance, e.g., through expectations, and at the level of outcomes, by a probabilistic integration function. The model is based on the causal structure of the team task, and as such abstracts from characteristics of the agents who are assigned responsibility. For example, the model can be equally applied to voluntary actions and to physical occurrences. However, factors such as intentionality and foreseeability have been shown to play an important role in responsibility attributions (Gerstenberg, Lagnado, & Kareev, 2010; Gerstenberg & Lagnado, 2012; Lagnado & Channon, 2008; McClure, Hilton, & Sutton, 2007; Schächtele, Gerstenberg, & Lagnado, 2010). A related issue is the choice element in the action. In our setup, the individual outcome is (assumed to be) determined by a combination of skill and luck. However, the model can be easily applied to strategic decision-making situations such as contributions to a threshold public good (Rapoport, 1987). Future work is needed to establish whether different cognitive rules govern responsibility attributions in strategic contexts. In our theoretical analysis and empirical implementation, we did not treat responsibility and blame as separate constructs. However, several frameworks exist that distinguish between the two concepts based on various considerations. Compared to responsibility, blame is associated with negative, and in particular severe, outcomes (Weiner, 1995); can be mitigated by possible justifications (Shaver, 1985) and ignorance on the part of the acting agent (Chockler & Halpern, 2004); and in the view of some scholars is closely linked with emotional responses (Alicke, 2000). These distinctions are not consequential in our simple framework, in which we look at blame attributions in a somewhat artificial and impartial setting which is not likely to arouse strong emotional responses. Having established the role of counterfactual and causal reasoning in responsibility attributions in such minimal setting, further research can incorporate mitigating and affective aspects into the situation. Moreover, the framework can be naturally extended to include the epistemic states of the agents. Finally, we studied responsibility attributions made by external observers, somewhat similar to attributions made by jury members or sports fans. In many relevant situations, however, responsibility attributions are made by the team members themselves. In such situations, judges may have a higher motivation to reach an informed judgment, enhancing counterfactual reasoning. On the other hand, self attributions might be susceptible to a self-serving bias (Campbell & Sedikides, 1999), shifting focus as to reduce blame or increase credit to oneself. Egocentric biases may also influence responsibility attributions by putting increased weights on counterfactuals involving oneself when attributing responsibility to peers. Individuals make contributions to team projects across a large array of domains, ranging from school assignments to criminal activities. In many cases, those individuals incur blame or credit from themselves and from others. This paper establishes the important role of counterfactual and causal reasoning in responsibility attributions in teams, laying a foundation for the study of the way in which people place blame and credit within the rich environment of team performance.

Highlights ► We investigated the role of two personality traits in moral judgment using fMRI. ► Psychoticism and need for cognition correlated with number of utilitarian decisions. ► Only psychoticism was associated with reduced activation in the subgenual ACC. ► Our data suggest that utilitarian judgments can reflect a reduced aversion to harm. ► They offer little support to a tie between utilitarian judgment and greater deliberation. Abstract Recent research on moral decision-making has suggested that many common moral judgments are based on immediate intuitions. However, some individuals arrive at highly counterintuitive utilitarian conclusions about when it is permissible to harm other individuals. Such utilitarian judgments have been attributed to effortful reasoning that has overcome our natural emotional aversion to harming others. Recent studies, however, suggest that such utilitarian judgments might also result from a decreased aversion to harming others, due to a deficit in empathic concern and social emotion. The present study investigated the neural basis of such indifference to harming using functional neuroimaging during engagement in moral dilemmas. A tendency to counterintuitive utilitarian judgment was associated both with ‘psychoticism’, a trait associated with a lack of empathic concern and antisocial tendencies, and with ‘need for cognition’, a trait reflecting preference for effortful cognition. Importantly, only psychoticism was also negatively correlated with activation in the subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC), a brain area implicated in empathic concern and social emotions such as guilt, during counterintuitive utilitarian judgments. Our findings suggest that when individuals reach highly counterintuitive utilitarian conclusions, this need not reflect greater engagement in explicit moral deliberation. It may rather reflect a lack of empathic concern, and diminished aversion to harming others.

There is, however, a small minority that adopts the utilitarian view that we should push the stranger because this would save a greater number of lives (Cushman, Young, & Hauser, 2006). Such utilitarian views are controversial. Many people find them repugnant, and utilitarianism is often portrayed as a cold and calculating outlook that is due to a deficient affective sensibility (Hazlitt, 1824/1991). Utilitarians, however, argue that their counterintuitive conclusions are simply what results when, instead of just following our immediate gut reactions, we use moral reasoning to critically scrutinize them (Singer, 2005; Unger, 1996). They claim that utilitarians are not colder than other people; but they may appear so because they are more ‘calculating’ or rational. Recent research has been taken to support for the latter view. Neuroimaging studies of affect-laden moral dilemmas have been taken to suggest that non-utilitarian or ‘deontological’ judgments (e.g. ‘don’t push the stranger’) are based on a pre-potent emotional aversion to directly harming others (Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, & Cohen, 2004; Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001). By contrast, utilitarian judgments (e.g. ‘push the stranger to save five others’) in difficult dilemmas were associated with increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior parietal lobe, areas implicated in deliberative processing, and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), an area implicated in the detection and resolution of conflict (Greene et al., 2004). In addition, recent studies have reported that cognitive load increased response times in utilitarian judgments but not in deontological ones (Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2008), and that subjects higher on ‘need for cognition’ (Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, & Jarvis, 1996), a motivational tendency to seek and enjoy effortful cognitive activity, exhibited greater rates of utilitarian judgment (Bartels, 2008). These findings suggest that utilitarian judgments involve the use of effortful, deliberative processing to overcome an immediate emotional response (Greene, 2008; though see Kahane, 2012; Kahane & Shackel, 2010; Kahane et al., 2012). Several recent studies, however, indicate that utilitarian judgment can also be the consequence of a lack of empathic concern. Some evidence for this comes from clinical populations. Patients with lesions in the VMPFC (Ciaramelli, Muccioli, Làdavas, & di Pellegrino, 2007; Koenigs et al., 2007; Moretto, Làdavas, Mattioli, & di Pellegrino, 2009) and with frontotemporal dementia (Mendez, Anderson, & Shapira, 2005), conditions associated with deficits in empathic concern and social emotion and with disordered social behavior, exhibit increased rates of utilitarian judgment in emotionally-loaded moral dilemmas, apparently because such patients lack the prepotent aversive response to harming. A recent study has shown that utilitarian judgments in patients with VMPFC damage were associated with weaker skin conductance responses, and with shorter reaction times, compared to healthy subjects (Moretto et al., 2009), further suggesting that in these patients utilitarian judgments do not require the overcoming of an aversion to harming others. However, diminished social emotion can also be found in the non-clinical population. It is thus plausible that utilitarian judgments in healthy individuals might also be rooted in an atypically weak or even absent aversion to harming others. This would explain the otherwise puzzling findings that increased rates of utilitarian judgment in healthy individuals are predicted by individual differences in aversive reactivity to harming others, as indexed by peripheral vasoconstriction (Cushman, Gray, Gaffey, & Mendes, 2012), and are associated with lower response times (Greene et al., 2008) and reduced skin conductance response (Moretto et al., 2009). In addition, recent studies report that such a tendency to utilitarian judgment in healthy subjects is associated with lower rates of trait empathy (Choe & Min, 2011; Crockett, Clark, Hauser, & Robbins, 2010), and higher levels of testosterone (Carney & Mason, 2010), which has been associated with reduced empathic concern (Hermans, Putman, & Van Honk, 2006). Most importantly, several recent studies report greater rates of utilitarian judgment in individuals high on psychopathy (Bartels & Pizarro, 2011; Glenn, Koleva, Iyer, Graham, & Ditto, 2010; Koenigs, Kruepke, Zeier, & Newman, 2012), although interestingly such a relation was not observed in some studies of psychiatric patients and criminal offenders (Cima, Tonnaer, & Hauser, 2010; Glenn, Raine, & Schug, 2009). There is thus a growing body of evidence indicating that utilitarian judgment in the healthy population may be based, not in greater deliberative effort as suggested by earlier research (Greene, 2008), but in a diminished or absent aversion to harming that is, moreover, associated with antisocial traits (Bartels & Pizarro, 2011). On this emerging picture of utilitarian judgment, utilitarians approach moral decisions in a calculating manner because they are ‘colder’ than other people. 2 The coldness in question refers to a lack of empathic concern and diminished prosocial emotion. It need not imply a general absence of emotion. Indeed, patients with VMPFC damage and psychopaths reject more unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game, a response pattern that is likely to be due to increased anger (Koenigs et al., 2007). In line with this, a recent study reports that a general disposition to feel angry was associated with greater rates of utilitarian judgment (Choe & Min, 2011). 2 However, the neural mechanisms that underlie individual differences in utilitarian judgment remain unclear, and there has so far been no attempt to integrate these seemingly contrasting lines of evidence. One plausible hypothesis is that there are two distinct pathways to utilitarian judgement. Some individuals might make utilitarian judgments because they are more calculating or ‘rational’, and others because they are colder. It cannot yet be ruled out, however, that the evidence associating utilitarian judgment with greater cognitive effort at least partly reflects the more calculating form that moral decision-making takes in the absence of normal emotional input. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers to investigate the neural basis of reduced aversion to harming in counterintuitive utilitarian judgment. Unlike previous studies, we employed measures of individual differences both in ‘coldness’ and in ‘calculation’. We predicted that two distinct personality traits would be associated with a greater tendency to utilitarian judgment in emotionally-loaded dilemmas: need for cognition, a motivational tendency to seek effortful cognitive activity (Cacioppo et al., 1996), and psychoticism, a subscale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1991) that reflects lack of emotionality, diminished empathic concern, aggression and non-conformity to social norms. Psychoticism has been associated with reduced sensitivity to violence in normal individuals (Bruggemann & Barry, 2002) as well as with psychopathy (Hare, 1982; Shine & Hobson, 1997), a construct often seen as lying on a continuum with psychoticism (Corr, 2010; Eysenck, 1992) although, unlike psychopathy, psychoticism primarily aims to capture a general dimension of personality in the normal population. We recently showed that counterintuitive judgments across a range of moral contexts are associated with greater perceived difficulty and with activation in the subgenual part of the anterior cingulate cortex (Kahane et al., 2012), a brain area previously implicated in the processing of social information (Behrens, Hunt, Woolrich, & Rushworth, 2008), and in altruistic donation decisions (Moll et al., 2006). The subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC) has been repeatedly implicated in negative emotions such as sadness (Mayberg et al., 2000), including feeling sad for the victim of a harmful action (Decety, Michalska, & Kinzler, 2012). Several recent studies have also associated the SCC with guilt, a self-directed negative emotional response to the belief that one has violated a moral norm (Green, Ralph, Moll, Stamatakis, & Zhan, 2010; Zahn, de Oliveira-Souza, Bramati, Garrido, & Moll, 2009b; Zahn et al., 2009a). Importantly, SCC activation in the context of guilt was found to reflect individual differences in empathic concern (Zahn et al., 2009b). Interestingly, the lesions in patients with VMPFC damage typically extend to the SCC, and previous studies report that individuals with VMPFC damage are significantly less likely to feel guilt when they violate social norms (Krajbich, Adolphs, Tranel, Denburg, & Camerer, 2009). Indeed, it has been suggested that VMPFC patients exhibit greater rates of utilitarian judgment due to a deficit in empathic concern and the capacity to feel guilt (Moll & de Oliveira-Souza, 2007; Moretto et al., 2009). In line with this, a recent study found that healthy individuals predominantly associate utilitarian judgments with feeling guilty (Choe & Min, 2011). These previous findings suggest that activation in the SCC may reflect aversive feelings such as guilt that are associated with agreeing to harm others and generally with the perceived violation of moral norms. Since psychoticism is associated with reduced empathic concern, aggression and insensitivity to social norms, we therefore predicted that utilitarian judgments by individuals higher on psychoticism should be reflected in decreased activation in the SCC yet not with increased activity in the DLPFC, a brain area generally implicated in explicit deliberation, and which has been previously associated with counterintuitive utilitarian judgment (Greene et al., 2004)—though as noted above, a reduced emotional response might also encourage a more ‘calculating’ approach to moral dilemmas. At the behavioural level, we predicted that such judgments would be associated with lower perceived difficulty. By contrast, if utilitarian judgments by individuals higher on ‘need for cognition’ involve greater engagement of explicit deliberation, they should be associated with increased activation in the DLPFC but not with decreased activation in the SCC. In addition, we would expect that increased deliberative effort would be reflected in increase in perceived difficulty. The above predictions are specific to moral dilemmas where, in order to save the greater number of lives, it is necessary to directly kill or significantly harm someone. In this type of dilemma, such a utilitarian choice is typically highly counterintuitive. Here, we also employed a range of new dilemmas that involved more everyday choices such as whether to lie to someone to avoid hurting them (see also Kahane et al., 2012). In these dilemmas, it is rather the deontological choice (e.g. to tell a harmful truth) that most people find counterintuitive. This new category of dilemma allowed us to disentangle the respective contribution of intuitiveness and content (utilitarian vs. deontological) to moral judgments. In order to investigate whether the hypothesized influence of ‘need for cognition’ and psychoticism on moral decision-making is specific to counterintuitive utilitarian judgment, we further examined their effect in this new category of dilemmas. Although individuals higher on psychoticism might feel less bound by moral rules such as the prohibition against lying, they might also be less reluctant to bluntly assert deeply hurtful truths. It is thus unclear that psychoticism should be associated with a distinctive pattern of response to this type of dilemma. By contrast, one would expect individuals who are attracted to effortful reflection to exhibit a general tendency to arrive at moral conclusions that go contrary to common intuitions. We therefore predicted that ‘need for cognition’ would be associated with greater rates of counterintuitive judgment and DLPFC activation across both categories of moral dilemmas. 2 Method The experimental setup and stimuli used in this study have been described elsewhere (Kahane et al., 2012). Here, we briefly summarize the methods and data analysis relevant to the research question of the present paper. 2.1 Subjects Sixteen healthy, right-handed subjects (9 female, mean age, 29.25, range, 21–41) participated in the study. The volunteers were pre-assessed to exclude those who self-reported a previous history of neurological or psychiatric illness. All subjects gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee. 2.2 Experimental design and protocol Two types of dilemmas were employed in the study: dilemmas where the deontological judgment is more intuitive (DI dilemmas 3 Example of DI dilemma: “A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks toward five workmen who will be killed if the trolley proceeds on its present course. You are on a footbridge over the tracks, in between the approaching trolley and the five workmen. Next to you on this footbridge is a stranger who happens to be very large. The only way to save the lives of the five workmen is to push this stranger off the bridge and onto the tracks below where his large body will stop the trolley. The stranger will die if you do this, but the five workmen will be saved. Should you push the stranger onto the tracks in order to save the five workmen?” 3 ; N =8), which were largely drawn from the ‘personal dilemmas’ used by Greene et al. (2001), as well as new dilemmas where the utilitarian judgment is more intuitive (UI dilemmas 4 Example of UI dilemma: “The husband of your close friend Jane told you that he had a secret romantic involvement with another woman four years ago but would never want to do so again, since his marriage means so much to him. On a night out with Jane she mentions that she was worried about her marriage four years ago. Jane goes on to say that her marriage is immensely important to her and that if her husband was ever unfaithful it would destroy the marriage because she would never be able to trust him again. She asks whether you’ve ever heard anything to suggest her husband isn’t faithful. Should you tell Jane that her husband had an affair?” For a complete list of dilemmas see Kahane et al. (2012). 4 ; N =10). ‘Utilitarian judgment’ was defined as the choice, of the two available, that would lead to the better aggregate consequence. A choice was classified as ‘intuitive’ (relative to a population) if it was chosen by 12 or more of 18 independent judges who were asked to give their unreflective opinion; the contrary choice was classified as ‘counterintuitive’ (for further details on the classification of dilemmas see Kahane et al., 2012). The experiment participants performed while they were lying in the scanner was divided into four sessions, each lasting about 10min. UI and DI dilemmas were presented in randomized order. Each dilemma was presented as text through a series of three screens, the first two describing a scenario and the last posing a question about the moral appropriateness of an action one might perform in that scenario (e.g., to push the large stranger). Each screen was presented for 15s. After reading the third screen, subjects responded by pressing one of two buttons (“yes” or “no”) to indicate whether they agreed to the suggested solution. Participants were instructed to read the text quietly, and to press the response button as soon as they had made their decision. No visual feedback was given upon the decision. At the end of each dilemma subjects were prompted to rate the difficulty of the dilemma using a Numerical Rating Scale ranging from 0 (=“not difficult at all”) to 100 (=“very difficult”). Participants were given 6s for the rating. At the end of each trial subjects were instructed to fixate a white cross that was displayed in the centre of the computer screen for 12s (baseline). 2.3 Questionnaires Prior to the scanning session all participants filled in paper-and-pencil versions of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (48-item EPQ-R Short Scale; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1991) and the short form of the ‘Need for cognition’ scale (Cacioppo et al., 1996). 2.4 Image acquisition MR scanning was performed on a 3T MRI system (Oxford Magnet Technology, Oxford, UK) with the use of a Nova Medical quadrature birdcage coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, USA). For the functional measurements, 33 axial slices (slice thickness 3mm) were acquired using a gradient echo echo-planar (EPI) T2*-sensitive sequence (repetition time, 2.38s, echo time, 30ms; flip angle, 90°; matrix, 64×64; field of view, 192×192mm2). Subjects wore MR-compatible electrostatic headphones to attenuate the scanner noise. For information regarding coverage of relevant brain regions, see Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. 2.5 Data analysis For the two personality traits (i.e., psychoticism and ‘need for cognition’) scores were calculated according to the questionnaires’ manuals and z-transformed to allow for direct comparison. Pearson correlation coefficients (1-tailed tests) were calculated for the relationship between the two questionnaire scores and (i) the number of counterintuitive utilitarian judgments (in DI dilemmas), (ii) the number of counterintuitive deontological judgments (in UI dilemmas), (iii) the average difficulty rating for counterintuitive utilitarian judgment and (iii) the average difficulty rating for counterintuitive deontological judgments. For the neuroimaging data image preprocessing and statistical analysis were carried out using SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The first five image volumes of each session were discarded to account for T1 relaxation effects. The remaining volumes were realigned to the sixth volume to correct for head motion before statistical analysis. The EPI images were spatially normalized (Friston et al., 1995) to the template of the Montréal Neurological Institute (MNI; Evans et al., 1993). The normalized EPI-images were smoothed using an 8-mm FWHM (full-width at half maximum) Gaussian kernel, temporally high-pass filtered (cut-off 128s) and corrected for temporal autocorrelations using first-order autoregressive modelling. In order to investigate the relationship between the two personality traits and the neural processes in the SCC and DLPFC during counterintuitive utilitarian judgments in DI dilemmas, we first computed two simple regression analyses. In the first simple regression analysis, first level images reflecting brain activation during counterintuitive utilitarian moral judgements were entered into a second level regression analysis with z-transformed psychoticism scores as a regressor. In the second analysis, individual ‘need for cognition’ scores were considered as a regressor in the analysis of brain responses during counterintuitive utilitarian judgments, again using first level images reflecting brain activation during counterintuitive utilitarian moral judgements. In order to identify brain regions showing a significantly stronger correlation with one of the two personality measures during counterintuitive utilitarian judgments, we subsequently performed a multiple regression analysis (Nichols, 2008). In this analysis, first level contrast images representing activation during counterintuitive utilitarian moral judgments were entered into a new model with the two questionnaire scores as covariates. The design matrix therefore comprised two regressors, one representing activation during counterintuitive utilitarian judgments that is correlated with individual psychoticism scores and one representing the same activation during counterintuitive utilitarian judgments but this time correlated with ‘need for cognition’ scores. On the group level, we used a “1 −1” contrast to test for any voxels showing a significantly stronger negative correlation with ‘need for cognition’ than with psychoticism using a t-statistic. Conversely, the contrast defined as “−1 1” tested for voxels showing a stronger negative correlation with psychoticism than for ‘need for cognition’. In order to explore the results of the multiple regression analyses in more detail, parameter estimates were extracted from the peak voxel and plotted against the individual psychoticism and ‘need for cognition’ scores. Following a similar procedure recently adopted by Zahn et al. (2009b), we considered effects of the three regression analyses as significant if they survived an uncorrected voxel-level significance threshold of p <0.01 and in addition a family-wise error (FWE) corrected threshold in a 5mm sphere around the original left or right hemispheric homologue of the mean coordinate (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates (x, y, z): −8.5, 25.5, −5.5) of SCC activations that have recently been reported in relation to guilt and empathic concern (Moll et al., 2006; Zahn et al., 2009a). For the DLPFC, the same small volume correction was applied to a 5mm sphere around the MNI coordinate (x, y, z =16, 55, 8) reported by Greene et al., 2004 (though for a different anatomical labeling, see Moll & de Oliveira-Souza, 2007). All coordinates are given in MNI space. Because neither of the two personality traits showed a significant correlation with the number of counterintuitive deontological decisions in UI dilemmas (see Results for details), we decided to not pursue the analysis of individual differences in counterintuitive deontological judgments at the neural level. 3 Results 3.1 Behavioral data 3.1.1 Correlations between personality traits and number of counterintuitive utilitarian judgments As predicted, the number of counterintuitive utilitarian decisions was positively correlated both with psychoticism (r =0.58, p =0.012; Fig. 1A) and with ‘need for cognition’ (r =0.51, p =0.023; Fig. 1B). These two scales were statistically independent (r =0.07, p =0.81). The frequency of making a counterintuitive deontological decision was not significantly correlated with psychoticism (r =0.10, p =0.361) or ‘need for cognition’ (r =−0.33, p =0.104). 3.1.2 Correlations between personality traits and perceived difficulty Based on our hypothesis that ‘need for cognition’ but not psychoticism should be associated with greater deliberative effort while making a counterintuitive decision, we investigated the correlation between the two personality traits and perceived difficulty during decision-making. For counterintuitive utilitarian decisions, ‘need for cognition’ scores showed a clear trend towards a positive correlation with perceived difficulty (r =0.449, p =0.05) while psychoticism (r =0.029, p =0.46) was not significantly correlated with difficulty ratings. For counterintuitive deontological decisions, neither psychoticism nor ‘need for cognition’ showed a significant correlation with perceived difficulty (psychoticism: r =0.434, p =0.061; ‘need for cognition’: r =0.133, p =0.333). Given the observation that psychoticism and ‘need for cognition’ were not related to the number of counterintuitive deontological decisions or the perceived difficulty of making such judgment, we decided to not pursue the analysis of individual differences in counterintuitive deontological judgments at the neural level. 3.2 Neuroimaging data Because psychoticism but not ‘need for cognition’ should be associated with a diminished empathic concern and aversion to harming, only the first should show a negative correlation with SCC activation. Results of the two simple regression analyses confirm this hypothesis. The higher the participants scored on the psychoticism scale, the lower the activation in the SCC (x, y, z =3, 30, −3; SVC: x, y, z =9, 24, −3, p =0.02, FWE-corrected) during counterintuitive utilitarian judgments (Fig. 2 A; Table S1). A negative correlation with DLPFC activation did not survive correction. ‘Need for cognition’ showed no significant negative correlation with either of the two brain regions (Table S2). In a second step we directly compared the correlations with the two personality traits using a multiple regression analysis. In this analysis, first level contrast images representing activation during counterintuitive utilitarian moral judgments were entered into a new model with the two questionnaire scores as covariates. The direct comparison of the two covariate regressors revealed that activation in the SCC was differentially correlated with psychoticism and ‘need for cognition’ (x, y, z =6, 24, −3; SVC: x, y, z =9, 24, −3, p =0.036, FWE-corrected; Fig. 3 A; Table S3). In order to explore this difference in more detail, parameter estimates for activation corrected with psychoticsm and ‘need for cognition’ were extracted and plotted against the individual scores of both questionnaires. As shown in Fig. 3B and C, psychoticism showed a significantly negative correlation with SCC activation during counterintuitive utilitarian decisions while ‘need for cognition’ was positively correlated with SCC activity (albeit below statistical significance). Activation in the DLPFC was not differentially correlated with the two personality traits. 4 Discussion Some individuals reach utilitarian conclusions that are contrary to widely held moral views and intuitions. One way to arrive at such nonconformist or ‘counterintuitive’ conclusions is by subjecting one’s intuitions and emotional responses to effortful critical scrutiny. Another way is not to have these intuitions in the first place. Are utilitarians more ‘rational’ and calculating (Greene et al., 2004), or are they simply colder, and less averse to harming others (Bartels & Pizarro, 2011)? Our results offer significant further support to the view that utilitarian judgments are often driven by lack of empathic concern and a diminished aversion to harming others. But they only offer a limited and qualified support for the view that such judgments might also be driven by explicit deliberation. 4.1 Cold morality: utilitarian judgment and lack of empathic concern At the behavioural level, we found that increased rates of counterintuitive utilitarian judgment were associated both with ‘need for cognition’, a tendency to engage in effortful deliberation, and psychoticism, a personality trait associated with aggression and lack of empathic concern. Importantly, these two measures were statistically independent, suggesting that they relate to distinct factors driving utilitarian judgment. In a previous study we reported that counterintuitive moral judgments in general, as well as counterintuitive utilitarian judgments in particular, were associated with increased activation in the SCC, a brain area implicated in empathic concern and guilt (Decety et al., 2012; Green et al. 2010; Moll et al. 2006; Zahn et al., 2009a, 2009b), compared to contrary ‘intuitive’ moral judgments (Kahane et al., 2012). By contrast, here we found that psychoticism was at once positively correlated with the number of utilitarian judgments and negatively correlated with SCC activation. This finding offers significant further support to the hypothesis that utilitarian judgment can be based in a deficit in empathic concern and social emotion even in healthy individuals, and suggests that the SCC reflects the degree of aversive response that individuals experience when they endorse acts that harm others in the context of making controversial utilitarian judgments. Previous work has shown that individuals who score higher on the psychoticism scale are characterized by non-conformity to social norms, and by lack of emotionality and empathic concern, hostility, and aggression (Eysenck, 1976). Such individuals perceive media violence as more comical and enjoyable, and show rapid habituation to violent material (Bruggemann & Barry, 2002), and reduced aversion to killing enemies in a video game (Ravaja, Turpeinen, Saari, Puttonen, & Keltikangas-Jarvinen, 2008). Since the association between psychoticism and utilitarian judgment related only to moral dilemmas that typically involved causing extreme harm to innocents, it is likely that the observed association between psychoticism and utilitarian judgment reflected a reduced aversion (or even indifference) to harming others rather than a general nonconformist tendency. This interpretation is strongly supported by recent research associating utilitarian judgment with weaker emotional responses to harming others (Moretto et al., 2009; Cushman et al., 2012) and lower rates of trait empathy (Choe & Min, 2011; Crockett et al., 2010), as well as with higher levels of testosterone (Carney & Mason, 2010). Utilitarian judgment has also been recently associated with psychopathy (Bartels & Pizarro, 2011; Glenn et al., 2010; Koenigs et al., 2012), a trait that is correlated with psychoticism (Hare, 1982; Corr, 2010). This growing body of evidence is also in line with the influential proposal that psychopathy is due to the malfunctioning of a ‘violence inhibition mechanism’ that is naturally operative in most humans (Blair, 1995). Further research, however, is needed to clarify the precise relation between psychoticism, SCC activation, and diminished aversion to harming others. The decreased activation in the SCC observed here may underlie the set of dispositions associated with psychoticism, or it might be a consequence of a greater degree of psychoticism, a causal question that should be investigated using longitudinal studies. The relation between the SCC and aversion to harm also requires further investigation. It seems unlikely that the observed SCC activation reflects an immediate emotional aversion to the prospect of harming others, since we previously found that the SCC was associated with counterintuitive judgments endorsing such harm rather than with intuitive judgment opposing it (Kahane et al., 2012). This SCC activation is thus more likely to reflect the guilt most individuals experience when they do agree to harm others, and more generally, to reflect a negative emotional response to the violation of a common moral norm (in line with Green et al., 2010; Zahn et al., 2009a, 2009b). Finally, our findings suggest that damage to the SCC might be implicated in the increase in utilitarian judgment observed in patients with VMPFC damage (Ciaramelli et al., 2007; Koenigs et al., 2007; Moretto et al., 2009), a hypothesis that, again, needs further investigation. Contrary to our prediction, psychoticism was not associated with lower ratings on a self-report measure of perceived difficulty. One possibility is that although it was in fact easier for individuals with a higher degree of psychoticism to make utilitarian judgments compared to other subjects, they nevertheless did not experience these judgments as subjectively easier. Another possibility is that participants higher in psychoticism were reluctant to report that they found it easy to endorse acts that directly harm innocents as others may see this in a negative light. 4.2 Calculating morality: utilitarian judgment and need for cognition Counterintuitive utilitarian judgments have recently been associated with feeling guilty (Choe & Min, 2011), and in a previous study we reported that they were correlated with increased SCC activation, compared to contrary intuitive judgments (Kahane et al., 2012). These findings strongly suggest that although individuals with a higher degree of psychoticism (or psychopathy) arrive at counterintuitive utilitarian conclusions because of a deficit in empathic concern, many individuals nevertheless find such judgments aversive. Some individuals thus need to effortfully overcome their natural aversion to harming others when making counterintuitive utilitarian judgments. It is a further question, however, whether explicit deliberation and moral reasoning play a distinctive role in utilitarian judgment even in these individuals. Our finding that ‘need for cognition’ was associated with greater rates of counterintuitive utilitarian judgments (yet not with counterintuitive deontological ones) is in line with this hypothesis (see also Bartels, 2008). However, as we previously reported, such utilitarian judgments were not generally associated with greater activation in the DLPFC or other brain areas implicated in deliberative processing (Kahane et al., 2012). Nor did we observe here an association between ‘need for cognition’ and DLPFC activation and other markers of effortful cognitive effort, such as perceived difficulty. This suggests that ‘need for cognition’ may lead to increased rates of counterintuitive utilitarian judgment not through greater engagement in explicit reasoning, but through some other factor. One possibility is that individuals who are more strongly disposed to effortful cognition also develop a general tendency to discount intuitive or emotional cues, and to be drawn to solutions to problems that appear more stereotypically calculating and ‘rational’ (for further discussion, see Kahane, 2012). This suggestion is in line with a recent study that found that a disposition to utilitarian solutions was associated, not with greater cognitive ability, but with a difficulty with reasoning thoughtfully about one’s emotions (Koven, 2011). It is noteworthy that although ‘need for cognition’ was associated with greater rates of utilitarian judgments in dilemmas where such judgments were counterintuitive, it was not associated with greater rates of deontological judgments in dilemmas where these judgments were counterintuitive. However, since we found no evidence that the correlation between ‘need for cognition’ and counterintuitive utilitarian judgment reflects explicit moral reasoning, this finding appears to offer little support to the view that utilitarian judgment is preferentially associated with such explicit reasoning (Greene, 2008). Moreover, on this latter view one would expect that extreme counterintuitive deontological judgments (e.g. refusal to tell a white lie, however harmful the truth) should be driven by especially strong immediate emotional responses, predicting both that such judgments would be negatively correlated with ‘need for cognition’, and that they would be easier to make. Neither prediction is borne out by our findings. As previously reported, such counterintuitive deontological judgments were perceived as more difficult than contrary utilitarian ones (Kahane et al., 2012). 5 Conclusion Utilitarianism has often been presented as the reasoned and systematic generalization of natural human empathic concern (Hare, 1981; Singer, 1979), and previous research has portrayed utilitarian judgment as an island of calm reason in a raging sea of unreflective emotional response—a rare example of genuine moral reasoning that can resist immediate gut reactions (Greene, 2008; Greene et al., 2004). Recent research has begun to cast doubt on any simple identification of utilitarian judgment with such explicit deliberation (Moretto, 2009; Bartels & Pizarro, 2011; Carney & Mason, 2010; Choe & Min, 2011; Crockett et al. 2010; Glenn et al., 2010; Koven, 2011; Koenings et al., 2012; Cushman et al., 2012). Our neuroimaging findings offer significant further evidence that counterintuitive utilitarian judgments are often driven, not by rational reflection or ‘generalized benevolence’ (Smart, 1961), but by a deficit in empathic concern and an indifference to harming others (see Fig. 4 ). One is reminded of John Stuart Mill’s remark on Jeremy Bentham, the founding father of utilitarianism: “[i]n many of the most natural and strongest feelings of human nature he had no sympathy” (Ryan, 1987). Moreover, although a lack of aversion to harming might lead to greater rates of utilitarian judgment in certain contexts, such a disposition is highly problematic even from a utilitarian standpoint. Utilitarian thinkers often argue that a strong aversion to harming others is itself of great utility because, although it can lead to suboptimal choices in some situations, in the long run it would lead to better consequences than a cold and calculating attitude that is not constrained by such aversion (Sidgwick, 1907). We do not want to be the slaves of our passions and intuitions. We admire the capacity to arrive at counterintuitive moral conclusions when it is based in a tendency to critically reflect on and, when appropriate, overcome common moral intuitions. The association between counterintuitive utilitarian judgement and a tendency to seek effortful cognitive activity can thus seem to favour such judgments (Greene, 2008). But the parallel association with lack of empathic concern and antisocial tendencies is rather less flattering (Bartels & Pizarro, 2011)—a tendency to endorse counterintuitive views is sinister when it merely reflects an indifference to harming others and a lack of responsiveness to common norms.

Abstract The pattern of shading across an image can provide a rich sense of object shape. Our ability to use shading information is remarkable given the infinite possible combinations of illumination, shape and reflectance that could have produced any given image. Illumination can change dramatically across environments (e.g. indoor vs. outdoor) and times of day (e.g. mid-day vs. sunset). Here we show that people can learn to associate particular illumination conditions with particular contexts, to aid shape-from-shading. Following a few hours of visual–haptic training, observers modified their shape estimates according to the illumination expected in the prevailing context. Our observers learned that red lighting was roughly overhead (consistent with their previous assumption of lighting direction), whereas green lighting was shifted by 10°. Greater learning occurred when training for the two contexts (red or green light) was intermingled rather than when it was sequentially blocked. Keywords Shape-from-shading Human visual perception Light priors Context specific learning 1 Introduction Humans cope with reddish illumination at sunset or flickering coloured lights at the disco – managing to decompose shading patterns into reflectance and shape variations – but how? Our impressively robust ability to estimate our surroundings, given complex and ambiguous retinal input relies heavily on prior knowledge – we bias perceptual estimates toward the most likely scenes. For example, we bias estimates of illumination direction toward overhead (e.g. Adams, 2007; Kleffner & Ramachandran, 1992) and estimates of surface shape toward convexity (Adams & Mamassian, 2004; Langer & Bülthoff, 2001) in alignment with the statistics of our environment (Potetz & Lee, 2003). Such assumptions, or ‘priors’, facilitate the notoriously under-constrained problem of recovering shape-from-shading. Here we investigate whether observers can further refine this process by learning that particular illumination conditions are more likely in particular contexts. For optimal performance, humans should (i) respond to long-term changes in scene statistics by updating their priors and (ii) select the correct prior for a given context. We know that humans do the former: in contrast with chickens (Hershberger, 1970), human observers change their light prior in response to appropriate haptic (Adams, Graf, & Ernst, 2004) or visual feedback (Adams, Kerrigan, & Graf, 2010). Here we ask whether humans also do the latter: can we learn different prior assumptions for different contexts? There is no clear consensus: although Adams et al. (2004) found that a modified light-prior generalised to novel stimuli, Adams et al. (2010) noted that modified light-priors were retained for several weeks beyond training, after observers had returned to their normal environment, in which lighting was presumably, on average, overhead. This latter finding suggests that observers learnt separate, context-dependent light priors, with the experimental set-up acting as a contextual cue. Here we ask whether humans can learn two light priors, each invoked by a different illumination colour. To induce colour-dependent learning, visual–haptic feedback was modulated by the simulated illumination colour: when scenes were illuminated by red light, feedback was consistent with the observer’s baseline light prior distribution. In contrast, under green illumination, feedback was consistent with a new lighting distribution. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Apparatus and stimuli Observers simultaneously viewed and felt virtual objects (see Fig. 1 a). Haptic scenes were presented via a ‘thimble gimbal’ attached to a force-feedback device (Ghost libraries, PHANToM, SensAble Technologies). Visual stimuli (Figs. 1b and 2 d–g), generated using OpenGL, were presented via a front-silvered mirror. Their perceived location (at a visual distance of 56cm) matched the location of the haptic stimuli, giving the impression of a single visual–haptic scene. A headrest and bite bar maintained head position and an eye patch eliminated binocular depth cues. The room was completely dark, other than the light emitted by the visual display. 2.2 Visual test trials Pre- and post-training trials contained solely visual (no haptic) information. Observers viewed four shaded discs, each subtending 5.6° and offset from the screen’s centre by 5.3° (see Fig. 1). Each disc was consistent with a hemisphere squashed in depth by a factor of 2, illuminated by a distant light source. The slant of the light source (the angle between the lighting vector and the screen normal) was 68.2°. The light source tilt (the angle between the projected lighting vector and the vertical axis in the plane of the screen, θ) varied across trials. This illumination tilt, with object shape (convex vs. concave) determined the shading orientation of each disc. Within each trial, one, two or three discs had a shading gradient direction of θ and the remaining disc(s) had a shading gradient of θ +180°, such that observers generally perceived both convex and concave objects to be present. The simulated scene was white, with either a red or green simulated light source although stimuli were equally consistent with red and green scenes illuminated by white light. Observers judged the shape (concave vs. convex) of one object (cued by a star). The observer’s light prior was estimated from the set of 288 visual trials (24 equally spaced θ values×2 colours×6 repetitions), lasting approximately 10–15min (see Fig. 2a). 2.3 Training trials Visual–haptic training was similar to that used previously (e.g. Adams et al., 2004, see Fig. 2d–g). Observers viewed four shaded discs (as in test trials), but also explored the scene haptically by running a finger (in a thimble gimbal) over the simulated objects. This haptic information disambiguated each object’s shape, and thus also the lighting direction. However, the relationship between shading orientation and haptic shape depended on colour (see Fig. 2b). On ‘red’ trials, stimuli were consistent with the observer’s baseline light prior; haptic shape matched the observer’s pre-training shape responses. On ‘green’ trials, however, the lighting direction was drawn from a range shifted by ±30° relative to the observer’s baseline prior (13 observers were assigned a +30° shift, 13 a −30° shift). Thus, on ‘green’ trials, some objects previously perceived as convex now felt concave, and vice versa. It is important to note that haptic feedback did not introduce an association between colour and shape; p(haptically convex|green)= p(haptically convex|red). Rather, for perception to become aligned with haptic feedback, the observer would have to learn a relationship between illumination direction and colour. After haptically exploring the scene for a minimum of 7s, including ‘touching’ all four objects, the observer pressed a button to continue. One of the objects then appeared visually (without haptics) in the centre of the screen for 1s and the observer judged its shape (convex/concave). By subsequently viewing and touching the object, observers gained feedback on their response. Each training set comprised 224 visual–haptic training trials (48 equally spaced θ values×2 colours×2 repetitions+2 extra repetitions of 8 θ values within conflict regions×2 colours), lasting approximately 60–90min. There is some evidence that people and animals learn to discriminate between two contingencies more quickly when trials are intermixed than when they are blocked (e.g. Honey, Bateson, & Horn, 1994; Mitchell, Nash, & Hall, 2008). To identify whether a similar advantage is observable for our context-dependent learning task, we assigned observers to either an (i) intermingled or (ii) blocked variant. In the first variant, red and green trials were randomly intermingled throughout test and training. In the second, colour was fixed within blocks of 24 trials. 2.4 Procedure On day 1, each observer completed a set of visual-only trials, followed (after a short break) by a train-test session (one set of visual–haptic training trials, one set of visual test trials). On day 2, they completed two train-test sessions, separated by at least 1h. 2.5 Participants Twenty-six naïve observers completed the experiment (intermingled variant: 10 participants; blocked variant: 16 participants). All had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal colour vision. Participants gave informed written consent and the local ethics committee approved the study. 2.6 Possible outcomes What might our observers learn from the visual–haptic training? What colour-dependent or colour-independent changes in shape perception might be seen? First, our observers might show no learning: if colour were ignored as a ‘nuisance’ variable, haptic feedback would appear noisy and inconsistent and thus might be discounted. Second, observers might ignore colour, but still modify their behaviour to reflect the aggregate of all feedback. Their light priors would thus move toward the average of the two trained lighting distributions, irrespective of stimulus colour. Finally, observers may learn (consciously or unconsciously) that particular colours are associated with particular lighting distributions. This would allow them to apply different prior distributions over lighting direction in different colour contexts. This context-specific learning would result, post-training, in different measured light priors for different coloured test stimuli – the same shading orientation would induce different perceived shapes under different illumination colours. 3 Results Light priors were estimated by fitting a simple Bayesian model to each observer’s test and training data (see Adams et al., 2010; essentially, the peak of the light prior is given by the peak of the ‘convex’ responses). We first checked whether the perceived shape of red and green stimuli differed prior to training. Three observers were excluded (one from the intermixed condition, two from the blocked condition) as their red and green baseline priors differed (ps=.015; .015; and .003, from bootstrapping). A single baseline light prior was estimated for each remaining observer, using their combined red and green pre-training data (M=−9.61°, SD=13.61°, across observers). All subsequent data were separated by colour to estimate colour-specific light priors. Results are shown in Fig. 3 . Training had a significant effect on shape perception (F(3, 63)=6.61, p =.003, ɛ =.67, G–G correction for non-sphericity, from 3 factor ANOVA (amount of training, training type and illumination colour), partial η 2 =.24). As training progressed, observers’ light prior distributions moved toward the trained lighting direction. Significant learning occurred after two sets of training (normalised baseline light prior=0°, vs. mean penultimate and final light-priors μ =7.71° and μ =9.45°, p =.012 and p =.042 respectively, from Bonferroni corrected comparisons). Importantly, our observers did show some context dependent learning: light priors were shifted significantly further from baseline when measured with green than with red test stimuli (F(1, 21)=5.28, p =.032, partial η 2 =0.20). Further analysis showed that this difference (green light prior – red light prior) reached significance at the first and third post-training tests (test 1: t(22)=2.26, p =.034, μ green =4.38°, μ red =2.20°; test 3: t(22)=2.25, p =.035, μ green =9.77°, μ red =6.61°). However, learning was not entirely context dependent: significant changes in light prior were observed for both illumination contexts by the end of training (green: μ =9.77°, red: μ = 6.61°, t-tests against zero: p =.011 and p =.045 respectively). Participants trained via the intermixed condition showed significantly more learning than those trained via the blocked condition (15.25° vs. 3.64° in the final test session, significant main effect of training type (blocked vs. intermixed): F(1, 21)=4.31, p =.05, partial η 2 =0.30). This parallels findings from perceptual learning studies in which intermixed training results in better discrimination between stimuli than when training is blocked (e.g. Honey et al., 1994; Mitchell et al., 2008). The current study demonstrates that a similar advantage is seen when acquiring context-specific priors, perhaps because intermixing contexts avoids habituation of the contextual cue. No interactions were significant. 4 Discussion We show that the visual system is able to learn and implement separate light priors for different contexts. After training, the perceived shape of ambiguous shaded objects was modulated by illumination colour. Our observers were able to switch between two different, colour-contingent light priors on a trial-by-trial basis. We are confident that our training affected visual perception, rather than creating a response bias: each test stimulus produced one of two, qualitatively different, shape interpretations (either convex or concave) and the observer simply reported which was perceived. From the observer’s perspective our task was trivially easy: he/she simply reported an unambiguous, dichotomous percept. This can be contrasted with tasks involving a continuous response variable, where the potential for response bias can be problematic (see Haijang, Saunders, Stone, & Backus, 2006; Backus, 2009for further discussion). Furthermore, this colour-contingent perception was implemented unconsciously – at debrief, observers were asked to identify any differences that they had noticed between red and green stimuli, beyond the obvious difference in colour. Although some spurious differences were suggested, e.g. there were more trials of one colour than the other, observers did not identify any difference related to illumination direction, shading gradient or shape. This implicit learning is consistent with other evidence that observers can learn cue relationships of which they are unaware (Di Luca, Ernst, & Backus, 2010). Did our observers learn a relationship between (i) illumination direction and illuminant colour, or between (ii) illumination direction and object colour? Our stimuli were equally consistent with white scenes under red/green illumination, or red/green scenes under white illumination. We suggest that the former is more likely; one can imagine illuminants at different locations providing differently coloured light. For example, the setting sun produces a more red/orange illumination than a mid-day sun, or a room may include red and green point light sources at different locations. In contrast, the latter interpretation requires that certain illumination directions are more likely when an object of a particular colour is present. In either case, however, separate priors over illumination direction have been learnt, one for each colour (of object, or illuminant). Context-dependent use of priors has clear benefits: implementing a light prior that accurately reflects the lighting statistics of the current context will lead to more accurate shape judgements. Interestingly, however, the observed learning was not entirely context-specific; observers did not fully differentiate on the basis of colour but instead showed a combination of colour-specific and colour-independent learning. This may reflect robustness to temporary, perhaps spurious changes in cue contingencies; previous experience suggests that illumination direction and colour are not strongly correlated. In other words, this learning response may reflect not a limitation in our ability to learn, but an optimal strategy given the likelihood of such changes. This robustness has been modelled using Kalman filters where weight is given to both historical and current input (e.g. Burge, Ernst, & Banks, 2008). A similar logic applies to the incomplete learning found here (final average ‘green’ light-prior 9.77°, vs. trained light-prior of 30°) and in previous studies with comparable training, where observers learned only a third (11°) of the trained light prior shift (Adams et al., 2004). Other research has investigated the priors over aspect ratio that contribute to orientation estimation (an elliptical retinal image may be perceived as a slanted circle). Knill (2007) demonstrated that observers use visual–haptic feedback to modify their prior on the aspect ratio of ellipses. Similarly to Adams et al. (2010), Knill noted that observers’ priors did not readapt on exposure to the normal environment, suggesting that learning was specific to the laboratory context. Later, Seydell, Knill, and Trommershäuser (2010) demonstrated that observers can learn separate aspect ratio priors for different shapes (diamonds vs. ellipses) but appear unable to learn aspect ratio priors conditioned on object colour. The authors suggest that colour cannot be used to modulate observers’ shape priors because colour is deemed to be unrelated to aspect ratio by the visual system: there is no ecological reason to link colour with aspect ratio. Our study shows that colour can act as a contextual cue; it may be that a relationship between illumination colour and illumination direction is deemed more plausible by the visual system. A similar argument is presented by Michel and Jacobs (2007). They suggest that learning will be relatively easy when an existing relationship is modified (parameter learning). In contrast, learning a new relationship (structural learning) will be difficult or impossible: they tested whether observers could learn an association between illumination direction and stimulus depth, but concluded that they could not. Under this framework, our observers learned the distinction between colour contexts because colour and illumination direction are sometimes related in the real world: the relationship has ecological validity. However, it remains unclear whether, given enough training, observers would be able to learn two different light priors for contextual cues that are ecologically unrelated to illumination (e.g. object shape or texture). Ernst (2007) demonstrated that people can learn to associate low-level cues (luminance and stiffness) that have previously been unrelated. This suggests ecological validity is not a necessary condition for learning. In broad agreement with Michel and Jacobs (2007), Backus and colleagues have shown that some cue associations are easier to learn than others (for a review see Backus, 2011). They asked which novel cues may be ‘recruited’ such that they influence the interpretation of an ambiguous rotating structure from motion (SFM) stimulus. Haijang et al. (2006) and Jain, Fuller, and Backus (2010) found that some cues (location, motion direction) were recruited as contextual cues that modulated SFM perception. However, they found that other cues (e.g. auditory cues and extrinsic visual cues) were not recruited to disambiguate the SFM stimulus (but see also Backus, Jain, & Fuller, 2011). We suggest that when a pair of cues has previously been unrelated in the environment, the visual system should represent this information; strong evidence that particular signals are unrelated allows the visual system to avoid learning new, spurious relationships. In contrast, learning will be faster when the visual system holds little information about whether or not two signals are correlated, or data that they are sometimes correlated. In this way, modification of cue-relationships may be better characterised as a continuum rather than by dichotomies such as parameter vs. structural learning (see Di Luca et al., 2010 for related discussion). 5 Conclusion In summary, we show that colour can be learned and used as a cue to context: observers are able to selectively invoke different light priors in different contexts, allowing accurate recovery of shape from shading in their current environment. This use of context-dependent priors will assist the visual system as it moves between lighting environments, particularly when direct information about the prevailing illumination is unavailable or unreliable.
