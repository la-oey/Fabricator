Abstract The belief that one can exert intentional control over behavior is deeply rooted in virtually all human beings. It has been shown that weakening such belief – e.g. by exposure to ‘anti-free will’ messages – can lead people to display antisocial tendencies. We propose that this cursory and irresponsible behavior may be facilitated by a breakdown of neurocognitive mechanisms underlying behavioral adjustments. In the study reported here, we tested the hypothesis that weakening belief in intentional control reduces cognitive markers of behavioral control. Participants performed a Simon task before and after reading a scientific text either denying free will (no-free will group) or not mentioning free will (control group). Results showed that the post-error slowing, a cognitive marker of performance adjustment, was reduced in the no-free will group. This reduction was proportional to a decrease of the belief in intentional control. These observations indicate that weakening the belief in free will can impact behavioral adjustment after an error, and could be the cause of antisocial and irresponsible behavior. Keywords Free will Post-error slowing Belief Action monitoring Intention Cognitive control 1 Introduction In many everyday-life situations we evaluate the impact of our actions and adjust them according to external constraints, such as environmental changes, or internal states, such as desires and intentions. This capacity to exert voluntary control over behavior is crucial for the adaptation to the external environment and also for successful interactions with other individuals (Baumeister, Crescioni, & Alquist, 2011). Empirical data support the idea that the belief that we can voluntarily control our behavior is a biological need and is adaptive for survival (for an overview see Leotti, Iyengar, & Ochsner, 2010). Belief in intentional control can be weakened after exposing individuals to deterministic messages that deny free will (Baumeister, Masicampo, & DeWall, 2009; Rigoni, Kühn, Gaudino, Sartori, & Brass, 2012; Rigoni, Kühn, Sartori, & Brass, 2011; Vohs & Schooler, 2008). Empirical observations from social psychology also show that reducing belief in intentional control can have negative effects on the way people behave, namely by reducing pro-social and altruistic attitudes and by increasing antisocial and aggressive behavior (Baumeister et al., 2009; Vohs & Schooler, 2008). It has been proposed that a loss of self-control – i.e. the capacity to override one’s impulses (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1998) – plays a crucial role in leading to such behavioral changes (Baumeister et al., 2009; Rigoni et al., 2012). More specifically, the exposure to a deterministic message would weaken people’s motivation to exert self-control. Since self-control requires individuals to make an effort and spend energy, as indicated by increased blood glucose level (Gailliot & Baumeister, 2007; Gailliot et al., 2007), a lack of motivation would lead people to go for more automatic and impulsive courses of action (Baumeister et al., 2009). Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to assess which parts of the information processing chain are affected by the belief manipulation (Rigoni et al., 2011, 2012). This research investigates how basic neurocognitive processes underlying voluntary behavior are affected by whether people believe they can exert intentional control. It has been found that the Readiness Potential, a neurophysiological marker of intentional action preparation, can be reduced when people are led to disbelieve in free will (Rigoni et al., 2011). Disbelieving in free will also reduces voluntary motor inhibition and the feeling of having deliberate control over a motor action (Rigoni et al., 2012). Taken together, these findings suggest that it is possible to reduce individuals’ belief in intentional control, and that weakening belief in intentional control may lead to a degradation of basic motor processes underlying voluntary actions. Here we present an experiment in which we tested whether reducing belief in intentional control can affect a specific aspect of intentional control, namely action monitoring. Action monitoring can be described as the ability to evaluate the adequacy and success of a performance (see Ridderinkhof, van den Wildenberg, Segalowitz, and Carter (2004) for an overview). How people retrospectively evaluate their actions is crucial to determine future behavior, as well as whether they feel responsible for the consequences of their behavior. Irresponsible and impulsive behavior following exposure to anti-free will messages may result from a breakdown in the evaluation of the consequences of behavior. Since dismissing intentional control leads to cursory and irresponsible behavior (Baumeister et al., 2009; Vohs & Schooler, 2008) and to less intentional involvement in the task (2012; Rigoni et al., 2011), we wanted to test whether monitoring of action effects is reduced by exposure to anti-free will messages. Experimentally, action monitoring is often investigated by use of conflict tasks (e.g. Stroop task, Simon task, Eriksen-flanker task). For instance, in the Simon task (see Simon, 1990 for a review) participants respond with left- or right-hand key press according to the color of a stimulus presented either on the left or on the right of a fixation point. A conflict occurs when response and stimulus location are incongruent, e.g. when a stimulus that requires a right-hand response is presented on the left of the fixation point. In these tasks, action monitoring processes can be assessed by studying “sequential effects”, that is, how performance on trial n is affected by the performance on trial n − 1. While large sequential effects reflect, at least partly, an appropriate action monitoring (Kerns et al., 2004), absent or diminished sequential effects reveals a degraded action monitoring. For instance, after an error subjects are typically slower (Rabbitt, 1966). This post-error slowing effect indicates a reaction to an error and is thought to partially reflect involvement of control processes (Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001; but see Notebaert et al., 2009). Thus, a large post-error slowing reflects an appropriate action monitoring (Kerns et al. 2004), whereas absent or diminished post-error slowing reveals a degraded action monitoring. Diminished post-error slowing has been observed in patients with schizophrenia (Alain, McNeely, He, Christensen, & West, 2002; Carter, MacDonald, Ross, & Stenger, 2001; Kerns et al., 2005), children with ADHD disorder (Jonkman, van Melis, Kemner, & Markus, 2007; Schachar et al., 2004; Sergeant & van der Meere, 1988; Wiersema, van der Meere, & Roeyers, 2005), whereas one study reported an increased post-error slowing in obsessive–compulsive patients (Fitzgerald et al., 2005; but see Hajcak & Simons, 2002). Taken together, these findings suggest that processes underlying behavioral adjustment may be disrupted in clinical conditions where intentional control is impaired. Our main prediction is that exposing participants to an anti-free will message that weakens the role of intentional control will impair action monitoring processes. We expect that the reduction of action monitoring mechanisms will be associated with a decrease in the belief in intentional control. To measure the belief in intentional control, we employed the Free Will and Determinism-Plus scale (FAD-Plus; Paulhus & Carey, 2011). The FAD-Plus includes items concerning distinct aspects of beliefs about intentional control, such as beliefs in free will (“People have complete control over decisions they make”), scientific (“As with other animals, human behavior always follows the laws of nature”) as well as fatalistic determinism (“Fate already has a plan for everyone”), and unpredictability of human behavior (“What happens to people is a matter of chance”). 2 Method 2.1 Participants Forty-four university students (30 females, 14 males), aged 18–32years (M =21.7±2.8) volunteered for this experiment, provided informed consent, and were paid 15euros for participation. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethic committee of Aix-Marseille I University, and by the “Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Méditerranée 1” (number 10 41). 2.2 Experimental design and procedure The experimental design was divided in a baseline and a post-manipulation session. Further details on the experimental procedure, the task, and ancillary self-report measures are reported in the supplementary material. 2.2.1 Baseline session First, each participant completed at home the FAD-Plus (Paulhus & Carey, 2011), that measures the belief in intentional control. This scale is composed by 27 Likert-type items (scores ranging from 1=totally disagree, to 5=totally agree) and includes 4 subscales (Free Will, Scientific Determinism, Fatalistic Determinism, and Randomness). At least one week after, an experimental session was organized for each participant in the laboratory. Participants first completed the Positive and Negative Affective Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). Then, in a separate room, they performed a classical Simon task: 1 training block and 4 experimental blocks were recorded (96 trials/block). 2.2.2 Belief manipulation Participants were then randomly assigned to two different groups. The no-free-will group read a text claiming that scientists now recognize that free will is an illusion, while control group read a passage from the same book – i.e. the French version of The Astonishing Hypothesis, by Francis Crick (1994) – that did not mention free will (Rigoni et al., 2011; Vohs & Schooler, 2008). Participants were encouraged to read the text carefully and that a comprehension test would have been administered at the end of the experiment. 2.2.3 Post-manipulation session After reading the text, each group performed 4 additional blocks of the Simon task. After the last block of the Simon task, the PANAS, and the FAD-Plus were followed-up. The duration of the entire session was about 1h and 15min. 3 Results Concerning the Simon task, reaction times (RTs) faster than 100ms (anticipations) and later than 1s (omissions) were not considered in the analysis (i.e. less than 0.003% of all trials). Data from 2 participants in the no-free will group were rejected because of the very low accuracy in the baseline Simon task – i.e. more than 2.5 standard deviations (SDs) lower than whole sample average. Two control participants were therefore randomly selected (the only constraint was that the two group averages were eventually comparable regarding baseline task accuracy) and excluded from the analysis. This was done to assure that the two groups did not differ with respect to task performance in the baseline section, as well as with respect to the sample size. After rejection, each group included 20 participants. The two groups did not show significant differences regarding age (21.7years-old±2.2 vs. 20.8years-old±2.6, for control and no-free will group, respectively) and education level (14.5years±1.3 vs. 14.3years±0.8; all ps >.1). 3.1 Belief in intentional control Scores on the Scientific Determinism (7 items) and on the Fatalistic Determinism (5 items) subscales were inversed and aggregated to the score on the Free Will subscale (7 items) in order to obtain a positive score of belief in intentional control – i.e. Free Will score + (35 – Scientific Determinism score) + (25 – Fatalistic Determinism score). We tested whether the manipulation changed participants’ belief in intentional control by entering the aggregated score as dependent variable into an ANOVA with session (baseline, post-manipulation) as within subjects factor and group (no-free will, controls) as between subjects factor. The analysis revealed a main effect of session (F(1,38)=4.65, p =.037, η p 2 = . 11 ), indicating a reduced belief in intentional control after the manipulation (52.7±8.6 vs. 50.62±8.4). Although the session × group interaction did not reach significance (F(1,38)=2.04, p =.16), specific comparisons showed that the reduction of the belief in intentional control was driven by the no-free will group (53.15±8.78 vs. 49.7±7.33, t(19)=2.61, p =.017), while it was not significant in the control group (52.25±8.61 vs. 51.55±9.45, t(19)=.5, p =.62). Since the two groups did not differ in the baseline scores (t(38)=−.33, p =.75) this finding suggests that the manipulation reduced the belief in intentional control mainly in the no-free will group. 3.2 Post-error slowing in the Simon task In the baseline session, mean RTs and error rates did not differ between the two groups, neither for the congruent trials (379.04ms±41.69 vs. 381.32ms±42.67; 96.22%±3.2 vs. 95.83%±3.27, all ps >.1, for the no-free will group and the control group, respectively) nor for the incongruent trials (407.65ms±43.4 vs. 406.44ms±36.58; 91.83%±4.4 vs. 93.44%±6.87, all ps >.1). RTs and error rates were then submitted to ANOVA with session and previous trial (correct, error) as within subjects factors, and group as between subjects factors. For RTs, the analysis revealed a main effect of the previous trial (F(1,38)=34.83, p <.0001, η p 2 = . 48 ), with slower RTs after errors than after correct trials (412.08ms±54.07 vs. 381.85ms±38.99, respectively). Importantly we found a significant session × previous trial × group interaction (F(1,38)=5, p <.05, η p 2 = . 12 ), with reduced post-error slowing after the belief manipulation in the no-free will group (36.99ms±28.09 vs. 21.75ms±29.92), but not in the control group (27.42ms±43.65 vs. 34.78ms±40.39) (Fig. 1 ). Paired comparisons indicated that post-error slowing effect changed across session for the no-free will group (t(19)=3.45, p <.01) but not for the control group (t(19)=−.81, p >.1). We found neither main effects nor interactions with error rates as dependent variable (all ps >.1). A correlation analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that the reduction of the post-error slowing effect was related to the change of the belief in intentional control in the no-free will group. A strong correlation was found in the no-free will group (r =.73, n =20, p < .0001), but not in the control group (r =−.33, n =20, p =.15) (Fig. 2 ). This finding indicates that the decrease of the post-error slowing in the no-free will group was more pronounced in participants showing diminished belief in intentional control after the belief manipulation. Interestingly, the slowing effect in the baseline session did not correlate with the baseline belief in intentional control (r =−.056, n =40, p =.73), indicating that the behavioral effect is related to the change in the belief in intentional control – i.e. as a consequence of the belief manipulation, rather than to the a priori belief itself. 3.3 Ancillary measures We wanted to exclude that other processes unrelated to the belief in intentional control were affected by the belief manipulation. For instance, the behavioral effects might be driven by a change in the emotional arousal triggered by reading the text. The PANAS scores were submitted to ANOVA with session as a within subjects factor, and group as between subjects factor. Overall, participants reported less unpleasant emotions in the post-manipulation session, as revealed by reduced PANAS negative subscale scores (17.58±6.55 vs. 14.98±5.35, F(1,38)=19.31, p <.0001, η p 2 = . 34 ). However, the session×group interaction was not significant (F(1,38)=1.83, p = .18). The analysis on the PANAS positive subscale scores yielded neither main effect of session (F(1,38)=.29, p = .59) nor session×group interaction (F(1,38)=.61, p = .44). 4 Discussion In the current study we showed that weakening belief in intentional control impaired cognitive reaction to errors in a conflict-task: the post-error slowing, a cognitive marker of performance adjustment following errors (Laming, 1968), was reduced in the no-free-will group after exposure to a deterministic anti-free will message, as compared to the control group (Fig. 1). Furthermore, in the no-free will group the decrease of the post-error slowing was proportional to the decrease of the belief in intentional control (Fig. 2). This finding indicates that weakening the belief in intentional control impacts performance monitoring, and more specifically error monitoring processes. The finding that the overall Simon effect (RTs and errors) did not differ in the two groups after the belief manipulation (see supplementary material) excludes the possibility that the belief manipulation decreased the overall performance in the no-free will group. In addition, no differences were found concerning other markers of performance monitoring, such as the Gratton effect (Gratton, Coles, & Donchin, 1992), suppression processes, as revealed by the analysis of delta plots (Ridderinkhof, van den Wildenberg, Wijnen, and Burle, 2004), and automatic response capture, as indicated by the conditional accuracy functions (Gratton, Coles, Sirevaag, Eriksen, & Donchin, 1988). This indicates that the belief manipulation specifically affected cognitive reaction to errors. However we also observed that, only in the no-free will group, increased intra-individual RT variability after the belief manipulation was associated with a decrease of the belief in intentional control (see supplementary material). This observation suggests that other processes reflecting performance control may have been affected by the belief manipulation (see Fiske & Rice, 1955 for an overview on performance variability). Previous studies in social psychology have revealed that weakening the belief that people can intentionally control their own actions strongly impacts behavior (e.g., 1989; Ajzen 2002; Bandura, 1982). Namely, the stronger people’s belief in their capabilities, the stronger and more persistent are the effort they put into behavior (Bandura, 1989). Recently it has been also shown that a disbelief in free will leads to antisocial tendencies, such as aggressive behavior (Baumeister et al., 2009) and cheating (Vohs & Schooler, 2008). We have argued that these effects on behavior are mediated by a degradation of basic neurocognitive processes underlying voluntary action, such as action preparation (Rigoni et al., 2011), intentional inhibition and perceived self-control (Rigoni et al., 2012). The current study extends these findings by showing that weakening belief in intentional control also impairs cognitive reaction to errors. How does weakening the belief in intentional control leads to such behavioral and neurocognitive changes? Our results indicate that behavioral effects result from diminished belief in intentional control – i.e. as a consequence to the exposure to messages that challenge free will, – rather than the initial belief itself. In addition, the analysis on the PANAS scores suggests that the effects are not driven by the affective valence of the text. This is in line with previous data (Vohs & Schooler, 2008) that showed that mood is not crucially involved in the behavioral changes after the anti-free will manipulation. One tentative interpretation is that exposure to explicit information challenging the role of free will in goal-directed behavior, would reduce the effort for implementing cognitive control (Ridderinkhof, Ullsperger, Crone, and Nieuwenhuis, 2004). In other words, participants exposed to an anti-free will message would spend less effort to adjust their performance according to contextual needs. Under this perspective, a decrease of post-error slowing in the no-free will group may reflect a reduced recruitment of cognitive control processes involved in action monitoring. An account involving diminished intentional effort for exerting cognitive control would be in line with prior observations of reduced intentional inhibition and perceived control (Rigoni et al., 2012), and reduced neurophysiological correlates of intentional action preparation (Rigoni et al., 2011), after exposure to information denying free will. Also, it may explain why weakening belief in free will leads to antisocial tendencies. A lack of cognitive control would likely result in more carless and impulsive behavior, and this in turn may lead people to display antisocial tendencies (Baumeister et al., 2009; Vohs & Schooler, 2008). In sum, our results indicate that weakening belief in intentional control can affect the way people react to errors in order to adjust their performance. This observation suggests that challenging the role of intentional control may lead people to be less concerned about the negative consequences of their actions. We propose that disproving intentional control by exposing participants to a message that denies free will results in reduced effort to implement cognitive control. A decreased intentional effort to exert cognitive control may be the candidate basic process accounting for the observation that reducing belief in free will leads to antisocial behavior.

(Of course many other forms are also possible a priori; here we show only those previously mentioned in the literature.) A linear effect is predicted by a simple guessing model. A logarithmic effect is predicted by both an optimal visual discrimination account (Norris, 2006) and an incremental processing account (see text). A super-logarithmic effect is predicted by the audience design theory of uniform information density effects (Levy & Jaeger, 2007). Fig. 2 These graphs show the whole-word processing times resulting from different variants of the incremental processing model. We consider: A linear effect at the fragment level (a, f(x)=−x) versus a reciprocal effect (b, f(x)=1/x), for different values of k. For k >1, we also consider two different possibilities for how probability is distributed among the fragments: Either uniformly ( p i = p word k , solid lines) or with later fragments more predictable than earlier fragments ( p i = p k ( k + 1 - i ) 2 with p k chosen so that p 1×⋯×p k = p word, dashed lines). In all cases, more highly incremental processing (larger k) produces a logarithmic effect at the word level (f(p 1)+⋯+f(p k )≈log p word). Fig. 3 The effect of the probability of word n on reading time measured at word n and on successive words (the spill-over region). Curves are penalized splines with point-wise 95% confidence intervals. To correct for inter-subject variability, we measure the effect of probability against the notional baseline of a perfectly predictable word; zero on this graph does not indicate an instantaneous overall reading time. Confidence intervals do not include the uncertainty induced by measurement error in probability estimation. Lower panels show the proportion of data available at each level of probability. (a) First-pass gaze durations. (b) Self-paced reading times. Fig. 4 By summing the curves in Fig. 3, we can estimate the total slowdown caused by an unpredictable word, regardless of where in the spillover region this slowdown occurs. (a) First-pass gaze durations. (b) Self-paced reading times. Lower panels show the proportion of data available at each level of probability. Fig. 5 To visualize inter-individual variation, we break down the Dundee corpus summed slowdown data (Fig. 4a), analyzing each participant separately. Participant codes from the corpus are shown in the upper right of each panel. Dashed lines represent bootstrapped point-wise 95% confidence intervals. The variation in ‘wiggliness’ of the main curves results in part from noise and numerical instability in mgcv’s GCV-based penalization selection (Wood, 2004) allowing over/under-fitting in some cases. Even so, 9 out of 10 participants show effects of log-probability with an overall linear trend, while no effect was found for participant ‘sg’. Fig. 6 The same curves shown in Fig. 4, but here plotted against raw predictability to better show the severity of the non-linearity. (a) First-pass gaze durations. (b) Self-paced reading times. Lower panels show the proportion of data available at each level of probability. (While these accurately indicate that the majority of our data is concentrated in the <0.1 range, the scale here is somewhat misleading; both analyses contain >10,000 data points with conditional probability >0.1.)

(a) Our original, penalized model (a repeat of Fig. 4). (b) The same model as in a, but fit with raw probability entered instead of log probability, then plotted in log-space. (c) The same model as in a, but fit without penalization. Upper panels show first-pass gaze durations; lower panels show self-paced reading times. That the lower panels show more wiggliness than the upper ones is presumably due to the relative sizes of the two data sets; in the absence of penalization, the smaller data set allows more overfitting than the larger. Dashed lines denote point-wise 95% confidence intervals. Lower panels show the proportion of data available at each level of probability.

Highlights • Human reading time for words varies logarithmically with word probability. • This is predicted by a novel incremental processing model. • It is also partially predicted an existing optimal perceptual discrimination model. Abstract It is well known that real-time human language processing is highly incremental and context-driven, and that the strength of a comprehender’s expectation for each word encountered is a key determinant of the difficulty of integrating that word into the preceding context. In reading, this differential difficulty is largely manifested in the amount of time taken to read each word. While numerous studies over the past thirty years have shown expectation-based effects on reading times driven by lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and other information sources, there has been little progress in establishing the quantitative relationship between expectation (or prediction) and reading times. Here, by combining a state-of-the-art computational language model, two large behavioral data-sets, and non-parametric statistical techniques, we establish for the first time the quantitative form of this relationship, finding that it is logarithmic over six orders of magnitude in estimated predictability. This result is problematic for a number of established models of eye movement control in reading, but lends partial support to an optimal perceptual discrimination account of word recognition. We also present a novel model in which language processing is highly incremental well below the level of the individual word, and show that it predicts both the shape and time-course of this effect. At a more general level, this result provides challenges for both anticipatory processing and semantic integration accounts of lexical predictability effects. And finally, this result provides evidence that comprehenders are highly sensitive to relative differences in predictability – even for differences between highly unpredictable words – and thus helps bring theoretical unity to our understanding of the role of prediction at multiple levels of linguistic structure in real-time language comprehension. Keywords Psycholinguistics Expectation Probabilistic models of cognition Information theory Reading 1 Introduction Making probabilistic predictions about the future is a necessary component of essentially every task that the brain performs, to the point that it has been proposed as a fundamental principle underlying its operation (Bar, 2009). One example of this is in language comprehension: As you read this text, you are unconsciously anticipating upcoming words based on the constantly-evolving context. For example, the sentence. (1) My brother came inside to… may well continue any number of ways, but native English speakers are in general agreement—and you will likely immediately recognize—that the sentence (2) The children went outside to… is almost certain to continue with the word play. Although play is perfectly reasonable as a continuation of (1), in (2) it is read more quickly on average (Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Kliegl, Nuthmann, & Engbert, 2006; McDonald & Shillcock, 2003a; Rayner & Well, 1996). A wide range of studies have shown that such effects of predictability or expectation for specific words affect not only reading times but also neural responses (DeLong, Urbach, & Kutas, 2005; Kutas & Hillyard, 1984; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Van Berkum, Brown, Zwitserlood, Kooijman, & Hagoort, 2005; Wicha, Bates, Moreno, & Kutas, 2003) and interpretation of temporarily ambiguous input (Altmann & Kamide, 1999; Dahan & Tanenhaus, 2004; Kamide, Altmann, & Haywood, 2003; Knoeferle, Crocker, Scheepers, & Pickering, 2005; Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard, & Sedivy, 1995). A second, related strand of research has shown that incremental processing difficulty is also affected by expectations for more abstract levels of linguistic content, including the predictability of different syntactic (Demberg & Keller, 2008; Ferreira et al., 1986; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, & Tanenhaus, 1998), semantic (Federmeier & Kutas, 1999), and pragmatic (Ni, Crain, & Shankweiler, 1996) structures. However, the relationship between the effects of expectations for specific-words and expectations for more abstract structures remains poorly understood. The most widespread method for assessing expectations for specific words is the cloze task (Taylor, 1953), in which native speakers are asked to write continuations of an incomplete sentence; in the examples above, play is the first word in over 90% of continuations of (2) but almost never appears as the first word of continuations of (1). However, the cloze task makes it quite difficult to precisely measure predictabilities <5–10%, and it is commonly assumed that differences in lexical expectation between items in this range do not produce behavioral effects. This contrasts with studies involving more abstract levels of linguistic structure, where expectation-based effects are observed even though the specific word instantiating the structure may rarely or never be produced in a cloze task. To take one recent example, Levy, Fedorenko, Breen, and Gibson (2012) showed that the word who and the immediately following region of the sentence were read more quickly in sentences like (3) than in sentences like (4): (3) After the show, a performer who had really impressed the audience bowed. (4) After the show, a performer bowed who had really impressed the audience. The word who never occurs in practice as a cloze continuation in either context (unpublished data), and so this result would conventionally be interpreted as arising from syntactic expectations (Hale, 2001; Ilkin & Sturt, 2011; Levy, 2008; Levy et al., 2012; Lau, Stroud, Plesch, & Phillips, 2006; Staub & Clifton, 2006): In (4) who is introduced by a grammatical construction (relative-clause extraposition) that corpus data indicate is both lower frequency and less likely given the grammatical context than the construction in (3) (ordinary postmodification by a relative clause), even though both are infrequent and unlikely in absolute terms. Probability theory, however, tells us that such differences in syntactic expectation should also produce differences in lexical expectation, even if these latter differences are too small to measure via the cloze task. We can quantify the predictability of a word w in context C as its conditional probability of occurrence in that context, P(w∣C). Similarly, we write the predictability of a syntactic construction S as P(S∣C). In these particular contexts, w = who can only occur if S =relative clause. The laws of conditional probability then let us decompose the lexical predictability as the product of two terms (Demberg & Keller, 2008; Fossum & Levy, 2012; Roark, Bachrach, Cardenas, & Pallier, 2009): P ( who | C ) = P ( rel . clause | C ) × P ( who | rel . clause , C ) The first term is the syntactic predictability, and the second measures the likelihood that this relative clause will begin with the word who (as opposed to, say, that). The latter is presumably roughly constant between these two contexts, which means that while the precise lexical predictabilities in (3) and (4) are too small to measure directly, the ratio between them should be similar to the ratio between their syntactic predictabilities. Motivated by such considerations, Hale has suggested that syntactic and other types of abstract expectations may affect processing difficulty purely by modulating lexical predictability, which under the surprisal theory of incremental language processing is measured as log-probability (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008). Within surprisal theory, lexical predictability forms a “causal bottleneck” through which the many different kinds of more abstract expectation discussed above must act. But as the above example shows, an essential requirement for this theory is that small absolute differences in expectation for low-predictability words must be capable of producing relatively large effects on processing difficulty, and it is not known whether this is the case. In fact, almost nothing is known about the quantitative form of the relationship between word predictability and the measurable correlates of processing difficulty such as reading time. This is in striking contrast to the study of isolated word recognition, where it has been known since the 1950s that recognition time varies almost exactly as a logarithmic function of frequency 1 Note that in psycholinguistics, the term frequency refers specifically to a word’s unconditional probability of occurrence without regard to context, P(w), making it quite distinct from context-dependent predictability. 1 (Howes & Solomon, 1951), and the need to explain this pattern has motivated a wide range of theories (Adelman, Brown, & Quesada, 2006; Baayen, 2010a; Murray & Forster, 2004; Morrison, Hirsh, & Duggan, 2003; Norris, 2006). But the few extant published studies (Kliegl et al., 2006; Rayner & Well, 1996) that have investigated the quantitive relationship between word predictability and processing time have yielded only limited insights, particularly regarding the shape of this relationship for highly unpredictable words, partly because of the cloze method’s limitations at measuring small differences in absolute predictability. Here we overcome these limitations by combining two large behavioral datasets of word-by-word reading times with probabilistic language models from computational linguistics (Chen & Goodman, 1998; Kneser & Ney, 1995; Manning & Schütze, 1999) and nonparametric statistical analysis. These methods allow us to establish for the first time the functional form of the predictability/reading-time relationship, and we do so over six orders of magnitude in probability, from near-obligatory to one-in-a-million events. (Due to the Zipfian distribution of language we encounter instances of the latter class of events relatively often, even though each individual such event is extremely rare.) We first describe a number of potential functional forms which have been hypothesized in the literature (see also Fig. 1 )—as well as giving a new theoretical motivation for a previously-hypothesized functional form—and then proceed to our empirical analysis. 2 Theories relating word predictability and reading time 2.1 Simple guessing (prediction: linear) The simplest possible curve that might relate predictability and processing time is a straight line; indeed, several modern models of eye movement control in reading apply a logarithmic transformation to frequency, but enter predictability linearly (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998). While we are not aware of any published justification for this practice, it does arise naturally from a simple and intuitive theory: Suppose that before reading each word, comprehenders make a guess at its identity by sampling from the distribution P(w∣C) (a probability matching strategy). If their guess is correct, then they continue undisturbed and can read the word in some baseline amount of time t baseline. Otherwise, they must spend some fixed additional amount of time recovering from their error—call this time t incorrect. If comprehenders’ estimates of this probability are accurate, then they will guess correctly on P(w∣C) proportion of trials and incorrectly on (1− P(w∣C)) proportion. Thus the average reading time will be (t baseline)+(1− P(w∣C))t incorrect—i.e., reported reading time will vary linearly with the word’s probability. Other authors have proposed a reciprocal (Narayanan & Jurafsky, 2004) or logarithmic (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) relationship, but based more on principles of elegance than any particular mechanism. There are, however, several more detailed reasons we might expect some specific non-linear relationship. 2.2 Analogy with frequency (prediction: none) At first glance, we might expect a logarithmic relationship for predictability because of an argument by analogy: Predictability is conceptually similar to frequency, and frequency has a logarithmic effect. However, the predictability and frequency of any particular word vary on very different time-scales: a word’s predictability may be radically different every single time it is encountered, because it is encountered in different contexts, but that same word’s context-independent frequency will remain effectively constant over a timescale of months at least. This presents an obstacle to wholesale importing of theories designed to explain the shape of the frequency effect. To illustrate this, consider Forster’s serial-search model (Forster, 1976; Murray & Forster, 2004), perhaps the most explicit extant proposal for why frequency has a logarithmic effect. In essence, this model assumes a frequency-sorted lexicon accessed by serial search; therefore accessing the 100th most frequent word takes twice as long as accessing the 50th most frequent word. Then, by Zipf’s law, these rank frequencies turn out to be approximately equal to the log numerical frequencies. The fact that frequencies are relatively stable over time makes a frequency-sorted lexicon plausible. Predictabilities, though, are dependent on context, and so change radically from one word to the next. A serial search model of predictability effects would thus require us to accept a lexicon that is completely reordered before processing each word. This is difficult, given that such a reordering would necessarily involve examining every lexical item, which would seem to remove the need for a second search step. Similarly, connectionist models of the word frequency effect explain it as arising from connection weights which are determined solely by training, and do not vary between contexts during the testing phase (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989; Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002; Zorzi, Houghton, & Butterworth, 1998). Other theories have attributed this effect to, for example, the age at which the word was first learned (Morrison & Ellis, 1995; Morrison et al., 2003), or differences in the ease of memory retrieval as determined by the number of previous exposures to the word, modulated by recency (Morton, 1969) or the diversity of previous contexts (Adelman et al., 2006). What all of these theories have in common is that they attribute the classic word frequency effect to some property of the word itself, while predictability is intrinsically a property of the interaction between a word token and its current context. We are currently unaware of any theoretical mechanism which would link the effects of long-term frequencies and local predictabilities, or cause them to behave in similar quantitative fashions—and the absence of such a mechanism makes it difficult to accord any weight to the argument by analogy. 2.3 Optimal visual discrimination (prediction: logarithmic) Norris, in the tradition of previous work using the Sequential Probability Ratio Test as a model of human choice reaction time (Carpenter & Williams, 1995; Gold & Shadlen, 2007; Laming, 1968; Stone, 1960), has proposed a model of word recognition as optimal visual discrimination: The Bayesian Reader (Norris, 2006; Norris, 2009). In this theory, the comprehender receives samples of noisy visual information at a fixed rate from their perceptual system, and their goal is to identify a word to some fixed degree of certainty as quickly as possible. According to Bayesian principles, the proper way to do this is to initially set one’s belief in the word’s identity to match its prior probability of occurrence—i.e., its predictability. Then, as each input sample arrives, this belief is updated by multiplying in the likelihood of the new sample and renormalizing. When the belief reaches some threshold, the word is declared to be identified. When transformed to log-probability space, this multiplication becomes addition, and thus the belief update process becomes a random walk in which each sample on average causes the log posterior probability of the correct word to increase with a near-constant step size. The expected number of steps—and thus the expected time—before reaching threshold for the word’s true identity is thus linear in the log of the word’s prior probability, so that in this model, the amount of time required to identify a word is proportional to its log-predictability (Carpenter & Williams, 1995). 2.4 Highly incremental processing (prediction: logarithmic) Here we introduce a second theory which predicts a logarithmic relationship between word probability and comprehension time. In fact, we show that if processing is “incremental enough”, then such a relationship will arise almost inevitably. We start from the observation that, so far as we can determine, stimuli which have higher predictability are processed more efficiently in every task and species where this has been studied (e.g., Carpenter & Williams, 1995; Froehlich, Herbranson, Loper, Wood, & Shimp, 2004; Janssen & Shadlen, 2005; Pang, Merkel, Egeth, & Olton, 1992). We take this as evidence that there are domain-independent mechanisms by which predictability modulates the efficiency of cognitive processing, and assume that the relationship between word predictability and reading time arises because of these mechanisms affecting linguistic processing, rather than some mechanism specific to language comprehension (Smith & Levy, 2008). (Of course, the processes which produce expectancies for particular words are themselves highly sensitive to linguistic structure and usage; here we’re speaking only of the mechanisms that link expectancies to reading time.) This assumption alone does not suggest any specific quantitative relationship between predictability and reading time. But if this is an instance of a more general predictability effect in which processing time for any stimulus is sensitive to that stimulus’s predictability, P(stimulus∣context), then we need to ask what constitutes a linguistic ‘stimulus’. Words are a privileged unit of linguistic representation, and psycholinguistic theories therefore tend to assume that cognitive mechanisms for manipulating linguistic representations will be sensitive to the properties of individual words. But are words the units by which real-time language comprehension proceeds? Our theory’s second assumption is that they are not: that instead, language comprehension proceeds incrementally, by which we mean that processing a word involves processing a sequence of sub-word fragments (Tanenhaus et al., 1995). In auditory comprehension, this is well established; speech unfolds over time, and if a speaker says candy then the listener’s language processor will be quite happy to start working on the initial /kæn-/ before they hear /-di/ (Tanenhaus et al., 1995). In reading, incrementality at the sub-word level is less well established, but might involve this same process after phonological recoding (Frost, 1998), or alternatively might involve multiple visual features (Morton, 1969) which arrive with different latencies and are processed in sequence. (Note that this does not require that the order in which features arrive matches the left-to-right order of letters within the word.) Putting these two assumptions together, we have that the processing time for each fragment depends on the predictability of that fragment. Furthermore, we assume that prediction for each fragment takes into account the previous fragments, and that the total time required to process two sequences of fragments is the sum of the time required to process the first sequence plus the time required to process the second. These conditions are trivially satisfied if fragments are processed in a strictly serial manner, but this is not a requirement; they are also satisfied by, e.g., models in which the processing for adjacent fragments overlaps in time, but uses a limited pool of shared computational resources so that higher degrees of parallelism result in slower overall processing. This is analogous to the observation that while there may be overlap in the processing of adjacent words (i.e., spillover effects), nonetheless reading multiple words takes longer than reading a single word. In this model, the predictability of words per se has no direct effect on their reading time; unpredictable words take longer to process only because they contain unpredictable fragments. This would seem to make it difficult to test the theory, because experimentally we can only measure word predictability and word reading time, not fragment predictability and fragment reading time. But fortunately, effects at the fragment level turn out to produce characteristic patterns at the word level. This follows from another difference between predictability and frequency. With frequency, there is no necessary relationship between fragment frequency and word frequency; e.g., a word can be rare without containing any rare syllables. True word frequency effects must therefore arise from whole-word processing. By contrast, the axioms of probability dictate that the context-conditional predictability of a word is the product of the context-conditional predictability of its parts, P ( / k æ / | context ) = P ( / k æ n - / | context ) × P ( / - di / | context , / k æ n - / ) . More formally, take a word with conditional probability p word that is composed of k fragments with conditional probabilities p 1,…, p k respectively. (E.g., if candy is processed as /kæn-/, /-di/ then k =2; processing it as /k-/, /-æ-/,/-n-/, /-d-/, /-i/ gives k =5. Processing it truly continuously gives k =∞.) And, let f(x) be the function that gives the processing time for a fragment that has probability x (we assume that there is a single f for all fragment types). Then looking only at the portion of processing time which is dependent on predictability, we have two equalities: p word = p 1 × ⋯ × p k total processing time = f ( p 1 ) + ⋯ + f ( p k ) . These equations let us simulate the total processing time that would result from different choices of p word, k, f(x), and p 1,…, p k . Fig. 2 shows the result of such simulations, and reveals a regularity: As k increases, the total processing time becomes a better and better approximation to a logarithmic function of word predictability p word: total processing time ≈ - θ log p word (Here θ is an arbitrary scaling parameter). Ultimately, this pattern is caused by the fact that in the equations above, probabilities multiply, while times add. If we set f(x)=−θlog x, then the above approximation becomes exact for all k, because logarithms convert products into sums. This makes the logarithm the unique fixed point of this process, which other choices of f(x) converge to as k increases. (A proof is given in Appendix A.) We do not, of course, suggest that the brain is actually literally calculating any limits; presumably some specific f(x) and k apply for each word that is read. What the above analysis means, though, is that so long as k is large—that is, processing is ‘highly incremental’—then we will be near the limit, and the details of choice of f(x) or the distribution of probability within the word will have only minimal effect on the observed whole-word reading time. A logarithmic reading time curve arises inevitably—and, perhaps, epiphenomenally—from using a coarse whole-word measure to examine a collection of fine-grained sub-word processes, each of which are sensitive to predictability. 2.5 Uniform information density (prediction: super-logarithmic) The uniform information density (UID) effect is that speakers seem to use various strategies to lengthen or shorten parts of their utterances so that the average predictability (as measured in bits) per unit time ends up being roughly constant (Aylett & Turk, 2004; Genzel & Charniak, 2002; Jaeger, 2010; Piantadosi, Tily, & Gibson, 2011). Levy and Jaeger (2007) proposed that one possible source of this pattern is as an audience design strategy. If comprehension difficulty induced by low-predictability words grows more quickly than the logarithm, then out of all ways of distributing a fixed amount of information across an utterance, the one which adheres most closely to the UID principle is also the one which will produce the lowest total comprehension difficulty. Intuitively, this occurs because for a super-logarithmic difficulty curve, Fig. 1, peaks in unpredictability produce a disproportionate amount of difficulty, which cannot be balanced out by an adjacent trough of similar size. So the logic of the proposed mechanism is: if producers attempt to make their utterances easy to comprehend, and if predictability has a super-logarithmic effect on comprehension time, then producers should adhere to the UID principle. The logic of empirical inference then inverts this: producers in many circumstances do adhere to the UID principle, and there must be some reason for this, so we should be predisposed to expect a super-logarithmic relationship between predictability and reading time; and, if one is found, that would provide further support for this account of UID effects. 3 Materials and methods Accurately assessing the shape of the word predictability effect requires a large number of data points distributed evenly over a wide range of predictability values. The availability of such data has previously been restricted by the difficulty and expense of gathering cloze data, and its analysis limited by the use of factorial designs. Three aspects of our approach allow us to overcome these challenges. First, instead of relying on cloze, we estimate word probabilities using a state-of-the-art computational language model trained on a large corpus. While undoubtedly more errorful than good cloze norming, this allows us to estimate predictability for relatively unexpected words and over very large stimulus sets, which compensates for the increase in noise. Other psycholinguistic studies have used such computational methods (Boston, Hale, Kliegl, Patil, & Vasishth, 2008; Demberg & Keller, 2008; Roark et al., 2009); the primary difference is that our language model is chosen to give best-effort broad-coverage word probability estimates, not to proxy for any particular psycholinguistic theory (Frank & Bod, 2011) or to give high-quality estimates for specific grammatical structures (Levy, 2008). Second, we avoid the factorial approach in favor of a spline-based regression technique designed for measuring non-linear curve shapes (Wood, 2006). (For a previous application of this technique to psycholinguistic data, see Baayen, 2010b.) This also enables us to control for confounds (e.g., word frequency) post hoc, which allows us to analyze large stimuli sets using relatively natural texts rather than carefully normed sentences. Finally, the use of regression allows us to directly ask how the probability of word n affects reading time for word n +1, after controlling for the probability of word n +1. This reduces confounding by controlling for word-to-word correlations in frequency, predictability, etc. More importantly, it gives us a new and powerful way to measure spill-over effects (Mitchell, 1984; Rayner, 1998), letting us better capture predictability’s full effect while additionally giving insight into its time-course. 3.1 Eye-tracking First pass gaze durations (Rayner, 1998) were extracted from the English portion of the Dundee corpus (Kennedy, Hill, & Pynte, 2003), which records eye movements of 10 native speakers each reading 51,502 words of British newspaper text. Previous work (Demberg & Keller, 2008; Frank & Bod, 2011; Kennedy, Pynte, Murray, & Paul, in press) has reported predictability effects in this corpus, but did not examine curve shape. 3.2 Self-paced reading Moving-window self-paced reading times (Just, Carpenter, & Woolley, 1982) were measured for 35 UCSD undergraduate native speakers each reading short (292–902 word) passages drawn from the Brown corpus of American English (2860–4999 total words per participant, mean 3912). In this paradigm, the participant must press a button to reveal each word in turn, and the time elapsed between button presses is recorded. Three participants with comprehension–question performance at chance were excluded. 3.3 Probability estimation Interpolated modified Kneser–Ney trigram word probabilities (Chen & Goodman, 1998; Kneser & Ney, 1995) were estimated from the British National Corpus (BNC Consortium, 2001) using SRILM v1.5.7 (Stolcke, 2002), and combined with a conditional bigram cache (Goodman, 2001). Self-paced reading analyses were adjusted for British/American spelling differences using VARCON (Atkinson, 2004). Our primary consideration in selecting this model was to maximize what Frank and Bod (2011) term ‘linguistic accuracy’, i.e., the model’s ability to accurately predict words in corpora (perplexity), without regard to behavioral data. We certainly do not claim that this model is an appropriate theory of how the human comprehension system goes about making predictions. But, to the extent that our model and the brain are both attempting to achieve linguistic accuracy, they should arrive at numerically similar estimates (see also Fossum & Levy, 2012), and the analyses we present here depend only on our estimated probabilities acting as an accurate statistical proxy for the true subjective probabilities. One possible source of inaccuracy is that in practice, our model relies primarily on local context for estimating predictabilities; in this respect it is similar to the transitional probabilities used in previous research (Demberg & Keller, 2008; Frisson, Rayner, & Pickering, 2005; McDonald & Shillcock, 2003a; McDonald & Shillcock, 2003b), though we use a larger local context and a substantially more sophisticated estimation procedure. In addition, the bigram cache portion of our model reaches beyond local context to create increased expectancies for repeated mentions of words and short phrases across the entirety of each stimulus text. Nonetheless, there remain a variety of long-distance linguistic dependencies induced by syntax, semantics, etc., which this model captures only imperfectly. This is in contrast to humans, who are generally sensitive to such long-distance dependencies. While this sensitivity is of great importance to theories about human expectancy generation, it does not affect our analyses here unless such dependencies have a large and systematic effect on the numerical magnitude of expectation for a large proportion of the words in our stimuli, which seems unlikely. Extensive experience in computational linguistics confirms that local-context models empirically outperform syntax-based models when it comes to achieving high linguistic accuracy in unrestricted-domain texts like ours. This suggests that while distant context can have large effects on the predictability of some words, in practice it usually does not; on average, local context is the most reliable cue to word predictability. Our estimates, therefore, while sometimes noisy, should serve as an accurate statistical proxy overall. Most importantly, there is no clear reason why this choice of language model would bias our results regarding curve shape in any particular direction. 3.4 Curve estimation We used mgcv v1.6–2 (Wood, 2004; Wood, 2006) to predict reading times using penalized cubic spline functions (20 d.f.) of word log-probability. As controls, we entered a spline function of position in text, a two-dimensional tensor spline interaction between orthographic word length and log-frequency, and factors indicating participant identity and (eye-tracking only) whether the previous word had been fixated. (This was motivated by preliminary analyses which revealed weak or non-existent interactions between predictability and either frequency or word length, but a substantial interaction between frequency and word length, which is consistent with previous findings (Kliegl et al., 2006; Pollatsek, Juhasz, Reichle, Machacek, & Rayner, 2008).) To capture spillover (Mitchell, 1984; Rayner, 1998), log-frequency/word-length interaction and probability terms were included for each word in an M-word window up to and including the current word, where M was chosen empirically to capture the effect present in each data set (eye-tracking: M =2; self-paced reading: M =4). All words were analyzed except those at the beginning or end of a line, or for which some word in the window did not appear in the British National Corpus, occurred adjacent to punctuation, or contained numerals. Eye-tracking analyses excluded unfixated words; self-paced reading analyses excluded outliers (reading times <80ms, >1500ms, or >4sd above participant-specific means). Eye-tracking: N =166,522; self-paced reading: N =51,552. Fitting was by (penalized) least squares; confidence intervals were estimated by bootstrapping both participants and cases within participants, using the mgcv fitter’s weights parameter to avoid replicating data across folds in its internal cross-validation routine. (This method takes subject random effects into account; for a discussion of item random effects in these analyses, see Appendix B.) All reported results were robust to choice of spline basis, use of least squares estimation versus maximum likelihood estimation with the assumption of heavy-tailed (gamma-distributed) error, and the use of larger spillover windows (increased M); see Appendix C for further validation of penalized spline regression in this setting. 4 Results Fig. 3 shows how the probability of a word w affects the reading time for w and the words immediately succeeding it (the spillover region). Our two data-sets show marked differences in time-course. For eye-tracking, the effect begins immediately and extends onto the next word, but is not seen on words further downstream. For self-paced reading, the effect does not begin until the succeeding word, and lasts through the third succeeding word. Nonetheless, if we sum these curves to find the total slowdown due to a particular unpredictable word (Fig. 4 ), then we find nearly identical effect sizes. This suggests that these tasks involve similar processing, though this processing is differently distributed through time with respect to saccades and button-presses respectively. Crucially, Fig. 4 shows clearly that the relationship between word predictability and reading time is, in fact, logarithmic across at least six orders of magnitude in probability. (Lower probability items occur, but not often enough to reliably estimate curve shape without a larger data set; see online supplementary information for graphs with the full x-axis.) Fig. 4 contains little visual evidence for super-logarithmicity. To check this more formally, we re-ran the above model fits, but now entering linear and quadratic functions of log-probability instead of an arbitrary spline (but keeping the same controls). A positive β coefficient on the quadratic term would indicate a super-logarithmic curve. We found no support for any quadratic component, positive or otherwise (eye-tracking: total β =−0.05, 95% CI=(−0.45,0.37), one-tailed p =0.59; self-paced reading: total β =0.04, 95% CI= (−0.90,1.07), one-tailed p =0.46; statistics via bootstrap). For the Dundee corpus, there were sufficient data to fit participant-specific models; results from these analyses are shown in Fig. 5 . Nine out of ten participants showed clear effects of log-probability, all of which are overall linear in shape. The individual-participant data for the Brown self-paced reading corpus were not plentiful enough to conduct participant-specific analyses. 5 Discussion The predictability effect on word comprehension in context takes a regular logarithmic form over at least six orders of magnitude in estimated predictability. This finding has both practical and theoretical consequences. Practically speaking, predictability is potentially affected by nearly any manipulation one can make to linguistic structure. It is therefore a potential confound in most psycholinguistic studies, and knowing the quantitative form of this confound allows us to better control it. This non-linearity is very severe—Fig. 6 . When word predictability is included as a covariate in regression analyses it should be log transformed; in factorial designs where average predictability is matched between conditions, it should be log-predictability rather than raw predictability that is matched. Since the uncertainty in the estimate of a word’s log-predictability for any given context will grow as the word’s predictability decreases, this also implies that in practice it is very difficult to assert with confidence from cloze norms that two different sets of word/context pairs are truly “equally” unpredictable in the sense that matters for real-time comprehension behavior. For example, a word whose true probability is 10−2 will act more like a word whose true probability is 1 than like one whose true probability is 10−6—yet these will most likely be measured as having 0%, 100%, and 0% cloze, respectively. Our results suggest that there is no such thing as an unexpected word; there are only words which are more or less expected. 5.1 Anticipation versus integration Our results bear on the theoretical debate about whether predictability effects in general arise from anticipatory pre-activation of specific words, or from post hoc effects that arise while integrating the word into some kind of larger semantic context. The integration difficulty account (Brown & Hagoort, 1993; Foss, 1982; Hagoort, Baggio, & Willems, 2009; Hess, Foss, & Carroll, 1995; Traxler & Foss, 2000) holds that predictability itself does not affect comprehension difficulty, but rather that words which have high predictability scores are also those which are somehow more related to the prior context, and words which are more related to the prior context are also easier to integrate semantically. For example, processing the word play in Examples (1) and (2) presumably requires us to construct some representation of two different scenarios: one involving my brother playing inside, and another involving children playing outside. If the latter scenario is easier to construct, then we expect play to be read more quickly in (2) than in (1). Crucially, under this account, predictability effects do not arise until after the comprehension system encounters the actual word; there may appear to be effects of predictability, but they do not result from any cognitive process of prediction. On the other hand, the anticipatory processing account holds that predictability effects do arise from some kind of processing which is predictive in the sense that it is dependent on the identity of the upcoming word, but occurs before this word identity is known (DeLong et al., 2005; Van Berkum et al., 2005). Our results provide challenges for both of these accounts. It seems plausible that predictability will, in general, be correlated with semantic integration difficulty, so perhaps the apparent effects of predictability in empirical studies are actually a result of this confounding. But, is this correlation tight enough to explain our results? Intuitively, we expect these measures to be similar in some cases, but to diverge in others. For instance, producers avoid saying things which are too obvious from context, and so statements of obvious facts presumably have a simultaneously low integration difficulty and a low predictability; similarly, syntactic alternatives with similar semantic content presumably produce similar degrees of integration difficulty, but may have wildly different predictabilities. Our results do not rule out an integration difficulty account, but given the precise and law-like relationship we found, the challenge for such accounts becomes to explain why integration difficulty should vary in a quantitatively exact way with the logarithm of predictability. The anticipatory processing account avoids this difficulty, because it is obvious why predictive processing would be sensitive to predictability per se; if you want to start processing words in some manner before you actually encounter them, then a word’s probability of occurrence given the available information, P(w∣C), may be a useful guide to decide which words should receive such processing, and to what degree. (Compare this to the situation after you have encountered the word, at which point it would seem mostly irrelevant how predictable it used to be when you had less information available.) And it has other appealing properties. It is independently motivated: there is ample independent evidence that the comprehension system anticipates upcoming material in at least some situations (Altmann & Kamide, 1999; DeLong et al., 2005; Kamide et al., 2003; Kamide, Scheepers, & Altmann, 2003; Knoeferle et al., 2005; Van Berkum et al., 2005; Wicha et al., 2003). And, it provides an obvious reason why predictability differences would produce differences in reading time (as higher predictability words will receive more anticipatory processing, and thus require less post hoc processing). However, the most straightforward instantiation of the anticipatory processing idea is the ‘simple guessing’ model we formalized above, which predicted a linear effect of predictability. Our results clearly rule this out. More generally, and for the same reason, these results are incompatible with any theory which assumes both that (a) predictability effects on reading time arise from processing which precedes the actual appearance of the word, and (b) the comprehension system can only apply this processing to a small number of words at any given moment (relative to the size of the lexicon). When such a model encounters a word with probability <10−5, it will almost never have formed any expectation regarding it—yet the observed effect is just as strong in this region of word log-probability as anywhere else. The reading time difference between words with probability 10−6 and words with probability 10−5 is just as large as the difference between words with probability 10−2 and those with probability 10−1. Thus, we must reject either (a) or (b). Integration difficulty accounts reject (a). If we wish to preserve an anticipatory processing account of these data, we must instead reject (b), and build theories in which expectancies do not take the form of simple guesses; instead, the comprehension system must be able to simultaneously pre-activate large portions of its lexicon in a quantitatively graded fashion (Smith & Levy, 2008). Yet another possibility would be for anticipatory processing to be directed not at words, but at word fragments, which would make this account consistent with the incremental processing theory we propose here (which takes as granted that there is some mechanism linking predictability and processing time, and focuses on explaining the resulting curve shape), while potentially reducing the degree to which parallel pre-activation is necessary (as there are e.g. far fewer potential upcoming phonemes than there are potential upcoming words). 5.2 Consequences for UID Our results lend no support to the audience-design account of uniform information density effects proposed by Levy and Jaeger (2007), which required a super-linear relationship between log probability (surprisal) and processing difficulty. We find no evidence for deviation from a pure logarithmic curve, which under their analysis would suggest that overall audience interpretation time is entirely unaffected by the uniformity or non-uniformity of information density. However, this need not be taken to rule out the possibility that other forms of audience design might motivate a UID principle. For example, if speech is consistently produced more quickly than it can be comprehended then it will eventually become incomprehensible, which gives producers an incentive to slow down on difficult content and let comprehenders catch up. In the case of predictability-related difficulty, producers who follow this strategy will end up following the UID principle, though under this revised account more local variation in information density would be acceptable. The original theory predicts that information density should be optimized on the time scale of individual processing fragments; here, what would matter is uniformity on a time-scale only fine-grained enough to avoid overloading comprehenders’ working memory. 5.3 The Bayesian Reader versus the incremental processing account There are two theories which predict the precise logarithmic effect we found: The Bayesian Reader (Norris, 2006; Norris, 2009) and the incremental processing account. Both find support in Fig. 4, but they make different predictions about the time-course of these effects, Fig. 3. In the Bayesian Reader model as originally formulated, predictability affects how much visual information the eye needs to gather from each word. This makes a clear prediction in the case of self-paced reading, where only one word is displayed at a time: Since you cannot gather perceptual input from a word that is no longer visible, the model expects a word’s predictability to affect viewing time for that word only, with no spillover effect. Fig. 3b, however, shows the exact opposite pattern: There is little or no effect on the word itself, with a large spillover effect. We can perhaps overcome this difficulty at the cost of some theoretical elegance, by postulating that the noise bottleneck occurs not in visual perception per se, but at some later moment where word identity must be communicated between two internal processing stages connected by a noisy channel. Further analysis would be needed to determine whether such a mechanism could produce slowdowns distributed over such a wide temporal span (2–3 words). The incremental processing account, by contrast, is based on the assumption that predictability affects not perception, but the speed of cognitive processing generally. Therefore, under this account we expect to see predictability effects at every moment that lexically associated processing occurs. Since spillover effects occur consistently in the psycholinguistic literature, this model makes the opposite prediction from the Bayesian Reader—that predictability effects should not be restricted to the period when the word is actually visible, which is what we find. While this prediction is not particularly surprising, it does make this the only extant model which can directly explain our full pattern of results. And this model, if correct, raises a number of new questions. Most obviously, what is the form of the true underlying function f(x) relating predictability and processing time? Is it an arbitrary and idiosyncratic function that, say, varies between individuals, or is there some regularity to it, and if so, what? Answering this would require some other methodology, as per-word reading times are too coarse-grained a measurement to yield much insight. Of even greater theoretical interest is the question of the value of k, the grain-size of incremental processing; larger k would correspond to the processor operating on finer-grained or perhaps even truly continuous chunks of input (McClelland & Elman, 1986; Spivey, 2007). Although these new results do not give direct knowledge of k, consider that most possible functions are not logarithms, and that Fig. 2 indicates that for some possible functions a rather large k (≫10) is required to produce a near-logarithmic curve shape like the ones we observe. Such a high degree of incrementality goes beyond what has already been established in the visual world paradigm (Tanenhaus et al., 1995) for the incremental processing of the speech signal, and certainly beyond what has otherwise been observed in reading. These results and model together, then, may provide an initial, tantalizing glimpse of a more fine-grained linguistic processor than has so far been exposed to experimental view. Other methods which allow more detailed measures of the time-course of processing, such as EEG/MEG, mouse-tracking (Spivey, Grosjean, & Knoblich, 2005), or hazard function analysis of eye movements (Feng, 2009) may yield further insights in this regard. 5.4 Surprisal as a causal bottleneck Finally, these results confirm that it is plausible that all reading time predictability effects are mediated by lexical predictability, in accordance with the causal bottleneck hypothesis of surprisal theory. Since the seminal work of Shannon on quantifying the bit rate of English (Shannon, 1951), information-theoretically informed work on language has recognized that all types of hierarchical predictive information present in language—syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and so forth—must inevitably bottom out in predictions about what specific word will occur in a given context, and that when measured in bits, expectations at each successive level combine naturally in a simple additive fashion. This is illustrated by our example from the introduction, where the total bits carried by the word who is the sum of the bits associated with the fact of a relative clause’s appearance in context C and the bits associated with the fact that the particular word introducing the relative clause is who: log P ( who | C ) = log P ( rel . clause | C ) + log P ( who | rel . clause , C ) Our present results reveal that the bit is also the correct unit for measuring the processing time needed in general during incremental language comprehension by a native speaker; a logarithmic effect of lexical predictability both implies and subsumes logarithmic effects of transitional probability, syntactic predictability, semantic predictability, etc., allowing us to explain these apparently disparate effects as arising via a single unified mechanism. With contemporary probabilistic models of language structure we can measure the bits carried by a wide variety of abstract linguistic structures; the way is thus paved for their contributions to the time required for incremental language comprehension to be investigated and quantified using this common currency.

Appendix A In the main body, we claimed that if these two equalities hold: p word = p 1 × ⋯ × p k total processing time = f ( p 1 ) + ⋯ + f ( p k ) then as k goes to infinity, the total processing time will become a closer and closer approximation to a logarithm of p word. Here we formalize and prove this claim. First, we need a way to talk about the p i values as k increases. Let’s assume we have a sequence of increasingly long vectors (p 1,…, p k ) k , for k =1,2,…. We’ll write the ith entry in the kth vector as p i,k , with 1⩽ i ⩽ k. As per above, we require that for all k, p 1,k ×⋯×p k,k = p word. We do not, though, require that there be any necessary relationship between p i,k and p i+1,k ; our result holds even if each new vector is totally different than the one before. What we do need is a condition to avoid degenerate behavior. What we want to avoid is a sequence like this one, where all the uncertainty remains restricted to a single fragment: p i , k = p word i = 1 1 i ≠ 1 Therefore, we require that as k increases, the probability of the most-surprising fragment should go to 1: lim k → ∞ min i p i , k = 1 This forces the word’s overall uncertainty to be distributed over an increasing number of fragments. Next we consider f(x). For convenience, we assume that f(1)=0. If it does not, then we can just subtract off a constant c, and this would not alter the shape of f(x). This will also affect the total processing time graph by shifting it up or down by k × c units, but this only affects the baseline reading time, not the shape of the curve. To avoid degenerate behavior, we also assume that the derivative of f(x) is defined at x =1. This derivative will play an important role in our story, so we give it a name: f′(1)=−θ. Now given these conditions, we wish to show that lim k → ∞ ∑ i = 1 k f ( p i , k ) = - θ log p word It will be easier to work with this after a change of variables. Let p ̃ word = log p word , p ̃ i , k = log p i , k , and g ( x ̃ ) = f ( e x ̃ ) . Plugging these transformations into our assumptions above, we have as given that p ̃ word = ∑ i = 1 k p ̃ i , k lim k → ∞ ( min i p ̃ i , k ) = 0 g ( 0 ) = f ( 1 ) = 0 g ′ ( 0 ) = f ′ ( 1 ) × e 0 = f ′ ( 1 ) = - θ and wish to show that lim k → ∞ ∑ i = 1 k g ( p ̃ i , k ) = - θ × p ̃ word . Note that since ∑ p ̃ i , k = p ̃ word , our result would hold if g ( x ̃ ) were the linear function - θ × x ̃ . The idea of our proof is to use the derivative to approximate g ( x ̃ ) as a linear function near 0. This turns out to be enough since as k increases, the p ̃ i , k values approach 0. More formally, recall from the definition of the derivative that - θ = g ′ ( 0 ) = lim h → 0 - g ( 0 + h ) - g ( 0 ) h = lim h → 0 - g ( h ) h Therefore, for any ∊ >0 there exists a δ >0 such that for all h ∈(−δ,0), g ( h ) h - ( - θ ) < ∊ which implies that - ∊ < g ( h ) h - ( - θ ) < ∊ - θ - ∊ < g ( h ) h < - θ + ∊ ( - θ - ∊ ) h < g ( h ) < ( - θ + ∊ ) h That is, for h ∈(−δ,0), g(h) is approximately linear with slope −θ ± ∊. Now, for k sufficiently large, we are guaranteed that p i,k ∈(− δ,0]. And so for such a k, we can infer that ∑ i = 1 k g ( p ̃ i , k ) is bounded by ( - θ ± ∊ ) ∑ i = 1 k p ̃ i , k = ( - θ ± ∊ ) × p ̃ word = ( - θ × p ̃ word ) ± ( ∊ × p ̃ word ) . That is, we can always pick k so as to guarantee that ∑ i = 1 k g ( p ̃ i , k ) is as close as we like to - θ × p ̃ word , which is what we wanted to prove. Appendix B A discussion of item effects in our analyses: In null-hypothesis significance testing within psycholinguistics, it is widely recognized that it is essential to take into account idiosyncratic differences among individuals and experimental items relevant to the dependent measure—both overall proclivities and sensitivities to psychological variables—because they break the conditional independence assumptions implicit in non-hierarchical (“flat”) regression models. This issue is what motivates the use of by-participant and by-item “random effects” in repeated-measures ANOVA and mixed-effects regression models (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008; Clark, 1973; see also Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily (2013) for specific discussion on this issue). The analyses above use a hierarchical bootstrap procedure (first on participant clusters, then on observations within each participant) that takes into account the by-subjects clustering structure in our data, but it does not take into account the clustering structure deriving from the fact that our data involve multiple measurements taken from a given [word,context] pairing—what would be called item random effects. Upon this view, the theoretically critical effect of word probability is “between items” rather than “within items”, since a given [word,context] pair always has the same conditional probability in our language model, so that a reasonable way to model item random effects would be to assume that the underlying hypothetical “average” reading time for a given [word,context] pair across the potential participant population is offset from that predicted by the other components by a factor b w drawn from some distribution with zero mean. This is known as an item random intercept in the mixed-effects models literature (Baayen et al., 2008). It is worth carefully considering how the results we obtained here might be affected by our omission of item random intercepts if they are present with non-negligible variance in the underlying generative process: 1. Omitting them could induce overconfidence in the parametric form of the probability/time relationship, artificially narrowing our confidence intervals. 2. Omitting them could induce the non-parametric model to overfit arbitrary, small deviations from the true underlying probability/reading-time function, since closely matching observed mean reading times for specific [word,context] pairs would produce spuriously high cross-validation scores and lead to the selection of too small a penalization term. The former could lead to unjustified overconfidence in the inferred effect size and shape; the effect of the latter would, if anything, make us less likely to obtain a cleanly linear effect shape. Since we nevertheless did obtain a nearly perfectly linear effect shape in both datasets, it is the first of these two possibilities, (1), that is of primary concern. We first demonstrate that when the effect of word log-probability is assumed to be linear, its effect is highly significant even when crossed subject and item random effects are taken into account. For both the Brown and Dundee datasets we fit parametric linear mixed-effects models (Baayen et al., 2008) to reading times. As fixed effects, we entered all predictors used in the main analysis except for participant identity, and with linear effects substituting for all splines. Our random effects structure included (i) a random intercept for word token, and (ii) random subject slopes for all word probability measures entered as fixed effects, with all correlations allowed (a “maximal” random-effects structure in the sense of Barr et al., 2013). Models were fit with (unrestricted) maximum likelihood estimation using the lme4 package (Bates, Maechler, & Bolker, 2011). Consistent with the findings of our non-parametric analyses, these analyses found that the linear effects of word log-probability were highly significant in all cases except for that of current-word log-probability in the Brown self-paced reading dataset (Dundee: current-word ∣t∣=2.88, one-back ∣t∣=5.59; Brown: current-word ∣t∣=1.35, one-back ∣t∣=4.83, two-back ∣t∣=3.68, three-back ∣t∣=3.13). In addition, we conducted a “by-items” analysis of each dataset, computing mean reading time for each word token (aggregating across subjects) and then fitting our non-parametric model to each dataset. (For the eye-tracking dataset this meant discarding the predictor of whether the previous word was fixated.) Results are shown in Fig. B1 and B2 ; once again we recovered effects on reading time that were linear in word log-probability. The main difference from our earlier results is that in Fig. B2, the self-paced reading effect appears somewhat stronger than the eye-tracking effect. If true, this may be an artifact of our excluding unfixated words from the eye-tracking analysis. Appendix C Penalized spline regression as implemented by mgcv (Wood, 2004, 2006) is a powerful and principled technique for estimating unknown non-linear relations. In order to fit nearly-arbitrary smooth curves, it uses a high-dimensional spline basis; in order to avoid the over-fitting that otherwise plagues such high-dimensional models, it combines the standard maximum likelihood criterion with a curvature penalty term that biases the regression towards less ‘wiggly’ curves. Critically, the relative weight placed on the likelihood term (which attempts to follow the data) versus the penalty term (which attempts to make the line smoother and closer to a straight line) is determined by cross-validation. In theory, therefore, this method’s fitted curves should be biased towards smoothness only to the extent that this helps it better match the true curve describing the underlying phenomenon. But since our key empirical finding is that such a fit produces a straight line, it seems prudent to verify that this is not an artifact introduced by penalization. We therefore repeated our analysis, but using two different methods to remove this potential bias. First, we ran the same model fits, but entering raw probability in place of log-probability; in this case we predict that the splines should attempt to form a steep logarithmic curve (since we believe that is the true underlying relationship), while the penalization pushes towards a linear relationship (Fig. 1). As expected, mgcv’s algorithm chose to apply very small penalization weights (ranging from 65 to 64,000 times smaller than the corresponding weights chosen in the original analyses), which in turn allowed the resulting spline fit to form an highly-nonlinear, approximately logarithmic curve with substantial local variation around this underlying trend (Fig. C1 b; note that while the fit was performed using raw probability, we plot the result against log probability to facilitate comparison with other fits). Second, we fit our original model, but with penalization simply disabled (i.e., using standard least-squares); this produced similar results (Fig. C1c). The three models thus agree that the underlying relationship is approximately logarithmic. Finally, we would like to confirm that the local non-linear deviations from this trend that we see in models (b) and (c) are the result of over-fitting rather than a true effect. We verified this by performing 1000-fold cross-validation on all three models, and found that in both data sets, the original penalized model (Fig. C1a) achieved the highest log-likelihood on held-out data. (Similar results, not shown, were obtained when performing cross-validation of the penalized model versus the other models on the “by item” data set described above.) Thus we conclude that, to the limits of our data, the underlying relationship between word probability and processing time is in fact logarithmic.

Highlights • Grapheme–color synesthetes display superior color working memory than controls. • This effect is independent of color familiarity and color discrimination abilities. • Controls and synesthetes do not differ in grapheme working memory. • These results support enhanced color processing in synesthesia. • They also support research linking sensory processing and working memory. Abstract There is emerging evidence that the encoding of visual information and the maintenance of this information in a temporarily accessible state in working memory rely on the same neural mechanisms. A consequence of this overlap is that atypical forms of perception should influence working memory. We examined this by investigating whether having grapheme–color synesthesia, a condition characterized by the involuntary experience of color photisms when reading or representing graphemes, would confer benefits on working memory. Two competing hypotheses propose that superior memory in synesthesia results from information being coded in two information channels (dual-coding) or from superior dimension-specific visual processing (enhanced processing). We discriminated between these hypotheses in three n-back experiments in which controls and synesthetes viewed inducer and non-inducer graphemes and maintained color or grapheme information in working memory. Synesthetes displayed superior color working memory than controls for both grapheme types, whereas the two groups did not differ in grapheme working memory. Further analyses excluded the possibilities of enhanced working memory among synesthetes being due to greater color discrimination, stimulus color familiarity, or bidirectionality. These results reveal enhanced dimension-specific visual working memory in this population and supply further evidence for a close relationship between sensory processing and the maintenance of sensory information in working memory. Keywords Color-processing n-Back Grapheme-processing Synesthesia Visual Working memory 1 Introduction Working memory allows the online maintenance of a limited amount of information in consciousness. There is emerging evidence that the encoding of sensory information and the maintenance of this information in a temporarily accessible state in working memory rely on the same neural mechanisms (Jonides, Lacey, & Nee, 2005; Postle, 2006; Serences, Ester, Vogel, & Awh, 2009). For instance, Serences et al. (2009) found that activation patterns in V1 during the maintenance of color and orientation information closely resembled those observed during the encoding of these features. A consequence of this overlap is that atypical forms of perception should influence working memory in the affected sensory modality. This idea can be explored in grapheme–color synesthesia, a form of idiosyncratic binding in which an individual involuntarily and reliably experiences color photisms (images or percepts; concurrents) when reading or representing numerals and letters (inducers; Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 2001; Rich & Mattingley, 2002; Ward, 2013). Currently there is no clear evidence that synesthesia affects working memory. However, multiple case studies (Luria, 1968; Mills, Innis, Westendorf, Owsianiecki, & McDonald, 2006; Smilek, Dixon, Cudahy, & Merikle, 2002) and group studies (Gibson, Radvansky, Johnson, & McNerney, 2012; Gross, Neargarder, Caldwell-Harris, & Cronin-Golomb, 2011; Radvansky, Gibson, & McNerney, 2011; Rothen & Meier, 2010; Yaro & Ward, 2007) have documented superior episodic memory for inducer stimuli in synesthetes than in non-synesthete controls (for a review, see Rothen, Meier, & Ward, 2012). Insofar as working memory and long-term memory reciprocally facilitate each other (e.g., Baddeley, 2012), it is plausible that enhanced working memory among synesthetes may subserve superior episodic memory in this population. Further evidence that synesthesia may affect working memory comes from studies showing that synesthesia impacts performance on selective attention tasks that include inducers (Dixon, Smilek, Cudahy, & Merikle, 2000; Dixon, Smilek, & Merikle, 2004; Mattingley, Rich, Yelland, & Bradshaw, 2001; Wollen & Ruggiero, 1983). For example, synesthetes are slower to identify the color of incongruently-colored than congruently-colored graphemes. Coupled with the recognition that the ability to selectively adjust attention is an important determinant of working memory capacity (Engle, 2002), synesthetes may experience interference costs on working memory from synesthetically-incongruent inducers, as has been found in word recall (Radvansky et al., 2011). However, a recent study found that synesthetes do not differ from controls in a standard Stroop color-naming task (Rouw, van Driel, Knip, & Ridderinkhof, 2013). Given the relationship between working memory and attentional control (Kane & Engle, 2003), this result suggests that synesthetes will not exhibit superior working memory, although it is possible that a synesthesia-specific working memory advantage is present for inducer or concurrent information. Although no model has specified predictions regarding working memory in synesthesia, such predictions can be derived from two competing hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the benefits of synesthesia to episodic memory. According to the dual coding hypothesis (Paivio, 1969, 1986), superior memory may occur when associated verbal and color information is concurrently encoded because the coding of information in multiple slave systems may strengthen the representation of the information. In non-synesthetes, for instance, working memory capacity is greater when stimuli are presented bimodally (e.g., audio and visual) than unimodally (Mastroberardino, Santangelo, Botta, Marucci, & Olivetti Belardinelli, 2008). Thus, synesthetes may display superior memory because they have two associated channels by which a stimulus can be encoded and maintained. For example, a grapheme and its concurrent photism may be maintained separately in a phonological loop and a visual cache, respectively (e.g., Logie, 2011), allowing either representation to be subsequently used to classify stimuli as the same (targets) or different (foils). This hypothesis readily explains enhanced memory for inducers in synesthetes (Gross et al., 2011; Radvansky et al., 2011; Yaro & Ward, 2007), as well as self-reports that synesthetes explicitly use color photisms as a mnemonic aid (Pearce, 2007; Rich, Bradshaw, & Mattingley, 2005; Rothen & Meier, 2010; Yaro & Ward, 2007). The dual-coding hypothesis makes clear predictions regarding the impact of congruency on working memory. Specifically, if the information in the two channels is congruent, working memory should be selectively enhanced in synesthetes, whereas if the information is incongruent, working memory maintenance should be weakened because of interference in the second channel. This prediction is consistent with the impact of synesthesia on selective attention, as described above. However, the benefits and hindrances conferred on memory by a dual-coding mechanism, as reflected in congruency effects on performance, are not always observed in synesthetes (e.g., Rothen & Meier, 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007). Similarly, in contrast with the predictions of dual-coding theory, two studies found that synesthetes did not differ from controls (Gross et al., 2011) or a normative sample (Rothen & Meier, 2010) in digit span tasks, alternately interpreted as measures of short-term memory or working memory. However, insofar as both studies used verbal material, neither was able to examine congruency effects in working memory for inducer stimuli. An important corollary of this account is that if superior memory is facilitated by a second, ancillary sequence code, then any memory advantage will be restricted to the domain of the inducer and will not be observed with stimuli that do not elicit synesthetic color photisms. This prediction is at odds with the repeated observation that relative to non-synesthetes, synesthetes exhibit superior recognition memory for color stimuli that do not elicit synesthetic experiences (Rothen & Meier, 2010; Yaro & Ward, 2007). The latter results suggest an alternative account, namely that enhanced modality- or dimension-specific processing among synesthetes facilitates superior memory in the respective modality or dimension. This enhanced processing hypothesis is supported by results showing that grapheme–color synesthetes exhibit superior low-level visual processing (Barnett et al., 2008), color discrimination (Banissy, Walsh, & Ward, 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007), precision of color and luminance matching (Arnold, Wegener, Brown, & Mattingley, 2012), and color recognition memory (Yaro & Ward, 2007). Superior low-level visual processing may strengthen representations held in working memory by amplifying incoming sensory information or excluding external noise (Lu & Dosher, 2009) and thereby enhance maintenance of the information. 1 Superior low-level visual processing in synesthetes (Barnett et al., 2008) may also entail superior working memory for graphemes and thus would provide an alternative explanation for superior grapheme working memory to the dual-coding hypothesis, although unlike the latter, such an account would not predict Congruency effects. 1 For example, it has been shown that individual differences in color constancy, which enables stable color perception across different levels of illumination, is associated with individual differences in working memory (Allen, Beilock, & Shevell, 2011). Shared mechanisms underlying perception and memory (Chun & Johnson, 2011) similarly entail that enhanced color perception among synesthetes (Arnold et al., 2012; Banissy et al., 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007) will translate to enhanced color working memory. Crucially, this account predicts enhanced working memory for color in synesthetes irrespective of whether the color functions as a concurrent. However, this hypothesis does not make explicit predictions regarding whether concurrent color photisms will benefit or hinder performance and thus it is agnostic regarding possible synesthetic congruency effects in working memory. The goals of the present study were twofold. First, we examined whether synesthesia confers any benefits on working memory. Second, we sought to discriminate between the dual-coding and enhanced processing hypotheses as applied to working memory in synesthesia. The dual-coding hypothesis states that synesthetes will exhibit enhanced memory for inducer graphemes but not non-inducer graphemes. The enhanced processing hypothesis, on the other hand, holds that synesthetes will display superior low-level visual processing that may be specific to color. This account therefore predicts that synesthetes will display superior memory for colors, but not (necessarily) for graphemes. To test these divergent predictions, grapheme–color synesthetes and non-synesthetes completed n-back tasks with colored inducer and non-inducer graphemes. In Experiment 1, participants responded whether or not the grapheme color was presented two or three trials back in the trial sequence whereas in Experiment 2, they responded whether or not the current grapheme was presented n trials back in the sequence. In both experiments we manipulated inducer grapheme–color pairs to investigate the presence of congruency effects on working memory, which are predicted by the dual-coding hypothesis, but not the enhanced processing hypothesis. To eliminate a confound of color familiarity in Experiment 1, we administered the non-inducer graphemes task with canonical colors in Experiment 3. We demonstrate that synesthetes display superior color, but not grapheme, working memory compared to non-synesthetes. 2 Experiment 1 In this experiment grapheme–color synesthetes and controls were instructed to hold grapheme colors in working memory. The enhanced processing hypothesis predicts superior color working for both inducer and non-inducer graphemes in synesthetes. In contrast, according to the dual-coding hypothesis, synesthetes and non-synesthetes should not differ in color working memory. However, color photisms experienced with inducer graphemes should facilitate superior performance for congruently-colored inducer graphemes and poorer performance for incongruently-colored inducer graphemes among synesthetes. The dual-coding hypothesis further predicts no advantage among synesthetes for non-inducer graphemes. To relate our results to previous findings, we also explored whether color working memory performance was related to individual differences in color discrimination ability (Banissy et al., 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007). Insofar as only preliminary research has been done on short-term memory and working memory in synesthesia (Gross et al., 2011; Meier & Rothen, 2010), it is unclear whether any observed group differences would manifest at information processing or decisional stages of task performance. For instance, performance differences across groups may reflect differences in the rate at which stimulus information is accumulated (drift rate), the amount of information required to make a response decision (boundary separation), or other nondecisional factors that influence responses (nondecision time) (Ratcliff, 1978; Wagenmakers, van der Maas, & Grasman, 2007). We investigated the processing locus of group differences by applying the EZ diffusion model (Wagenmakers et al., 2007), which incorporates different response components to estimate these three parameters for individual participants, as a supplement to conventional response accuracy and latency measures. 2.1 Method 2.1.1 Participants Sixteen controls (12 female, M Age =24.1, SD =1.5) and 16 grapheme–color synesthetes (13 female, M Age =23.9, SD =4.8) were recruited from the University of Oxford and consented to participate in accordance with approval from a local ethics committee. All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and were naïve to all hypotheses. Information for digit–color consistency was available for 9 synesthetes. On two separate occasions separated by 32days (range: 3–117, SD =34), using the same monitor, synesthetes identified from a color palette the colors that most closely matched their color photisms for the digits 0 through 9 and the respective RGB values (0–255) were recorded. We computed consistency using the formula described by Eagleman, Kagan, Nelson, Sagaram, and Sarma (2007), for which lower values reflect greater consistency. All synesthetes displayed consistency values well below 1 (range: .11–.56; M =.24, SD =.14), which is considered diagnostic of genuine synesthesia (Eagleman et al., 2007); consistency was unrelated to the number of days between grapheme–color association tests, r s =.10. 2.1.2 Materials 2.1.2.1 Working memory All participants completed two n-back tasks with colored inducer graphemes and non-inducer graphemes. Trials consisted of colored graphemes presented centrally along the horizontal and vertical axes of a computer monitor against a gray background at a distance of approximately 70cm, subtending a visual angle of 1.2–2.9°×1.6–2.9°. Stimuli were drawn from eight different colored digits and eight different non-inducer colored graphemes comprised of familiar punctuation and mathematical symbols that did not elicit synesthetic colors (÷ = # ∞ ∗ ↔ ? %). The same colors were used for both stimulus types. Inducer graphemes were presented in a congruent (50% of trials) or an incongruent (50% of trials) color with respect to synesthetes’ color photisms. Within blocks, for each grapheme, each of the eight colors was presented twice as a target, twice as a predictor stimulus (a stimulus that predicts a target) and twice as a foil (a stimulus that does not correspond to the n-back trial). Stimulus presentation was randomized within blocks with the constraint that each block contained 33% targets and 67% foils. Control participants were randomly assigned to the stimulus set of a synesthete. 2.1.2.2 Color discrimination All participants completed the Farnsworth–Munsell Color Hue Test of color discrimination (Farnsworth, 1957). This task consists of four sequences of 23 or 24 color caps (blue, green, pink and yellow) that vary in hue but have identical luminance. For each set, the first and last caps were placed in the correct sequence positions and the intermediate caps were randomized; participants were given 2min to arrange the caps. The score for each set was the sum of each hue’s deviation from the correct sequence and the mean set score formed the outcome measure (for further scoring information see Banissy et al., 2009). 2.1.3 Procedure Prior to the experiment, synesthetes were interviewed to corroborate their synesthesia and determine their grapheme–color pairs. Synesthetes were required to experience unique colors for at least eight digits. The eight digits that elicited the strongest synesthetic experience (by self-report) comprised the stimulus set; symbols that did not elicit color photisms, by self-report, were selected as non-inducer graphemes. All non-synesthetes reported having no grapheme–color associations. Participants first completed 2-back and 3-back practice blocks (40 trials) for the inducer and non-inducer graphemes task and then eight experimental blocks (48 trials) of inducer graphemes and four blocks of non-inducer graphemes (alternating between 2-back and 3-back blocks (e.g., Kane, Conway, Miura, & Colflesh, 2007)). All trials began with a white fixation dot for 500ms (see Fig. 1 ). The centrally-presented stimulus then appeared for 500ms. This was followed by a blank 2000ms interstimulus interval and then the next fixation dot. Participants were instructed to respond whether the current stimulus color matched the color presented either two or three back in the sequence by depressing one of two keys, corresponding to ‘yes’ and ‘no’ responses with the index and middle fingers of their right hand, using a Cedrus response pad (Cedrus Corporation, San Pedro, CA). The mapping of key to finger was counterbalanced across participants. Following completion of the tasks, participants completed the Farnsworth–Munsell Color Hue Test. 2.1.4 Statistical analyses We evaluated the dual-coding and enhanced processing hypotheses using error rates (ERs) and outlier-trimmed (±2 SDs) response times (RTs) in the two n-back tasks. In order to identify the processing locus of significant effects of relevance to the hypotheses under test, and disentangle different candidate mechanisms underlying group differences, we adopted a mathematical modeling approach using the EZ diffusion model (Wagenmakers et al., 2007). This model uses mean RT and RT variance on correct trials and ER to compute three parameters: v (drift rate), which indexes information accumulation and can be interpreted as a general measure of ability; a (boundary separation), which provides a measure of response conservativeness based on the volume of information required before a response will be provided; and T er (nondecision time), which indexes nondecision (visual encoding and motor) processes. We performed a series of EZ checks (Wagenmakers et al., 2007) across conditions and working memory loads to examine whether the data met the assumptions of the EZ diffusion model: (1) positively-skewed RT distributions; (2) equivalent RTs on error and correct trials; and (3) no interaction between response (error vs. correct) and stimulus category (foil vs. target) on RTs. We tested these assumptions using Bonferroni-corrected ANOVAs (Wagenmakers et al., 2007) and we report the percentage of violations and any effects on the analyses. Data were submitted to 2 (Load: 2-back vs. 3-back)×2 (Type: foil vs. target)×2 (Congruency: congruent vs. incongruent)×2 (Group: controls vs. synesthetes) mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVA). The Congruency factor was omitted in analyses of the non-inducer graphemes task. Subsidiary analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) included Color discrimination scores as a covariate in order to investigate its influence on the observed effects. We report 95% confidence intervals for effect sizes ( η p 2 ) for principal effects of direct relevance to the hypotheses under test. Multiple Congruency×Group interactions were non-significant and thus we sought to clarify whether these effects more closely supported the dual-coding or the null hypotheses using a Bayesian approach. Specifically, we contrasted the magnitude of observed Congruency effects in synesthetes against that predicted by the dual-coding hypothesis using the Bayes factor (B; Dienes, 2011), which indexes the likelihood of a hypothesis, relative to the null, given a set of data and thereby permits a more robust comparison between a tested hypothesis and the null than orthodox statistics. B values greater than 1 indicate that the data support the tested hypothesis over the null, whereas values below 1 indicate support for the null. Jeffreys (1961) further proposes that values between 0 and .33 should be interpreted as reflecting strong support for the null over the tested hypothesis; values between .33 and 3 should be regarded as inconclusive; and values greater than 3 should be interpreted as clearly supporting the hypothesis under test (see also Dienes, 2011). For these computations we used the M and SEM of the magnitude of the Congruency effect (incongruent–congruent) in ERs in the synesthetes and contrasted these with values predicted by the dual-coding hypothesis. We expected that synesthesia-specific Congruency effects in working memory driven by dual-coding processes should be comparable to those observed in a recall task that included inducer words that were either congruent or incongruent relative to grapheme–color synesthetes’ photism colors (Radvansky et al., 2011). The sample size (n =10) and gender distribution (eight females) of the synesthetes in the latter study were comparable to those of our samples in Experiments 1 and 2 (age data were not available for the Radvansky et al. (2011) sample, although all participants were university students). We computed the magnitude of the Congruency effect (incongruent ER–congruent ER) in Radvansky et al.’s (2011) study (M SynCong =.08, SD =.05) and included this as the predicted size of the Congruency effect in our computations of B (two-tailed). Along with B, we report the mean (M SynCong) and standard error (SEM) of the respective Congruency effect. 2.2 Results 2.2.1 Color discrimination Synesthetes (M =36.63, SD =14.27) exhibited numerically, albeit non-significantly, greater color discrimination than the controls (M =45.50, SD =21.93), unequal variance t(25.77)=1.36, p >.05 (lower scores reflect superior performance), although the effect size, d =.50, is not markedly lower than those in previous studies (d =.65 [Banissy et al., 2009]; d =.69 [Yaro & Ward, 2007]). 2 Yaro and Ward (2007) do not report descriptive statistics and thus this effect size was estimated on the basis of the respective figure. 2 2.2.2 n-Back tasks Descriptive statistics for performance on the n-back tasks in all experiments are presented in Table 1 . 2.2.2.1 Error rates In the inducer graphemes n-back, there was a main effect of Load, F(1,30)=75.90, MSE =0.02, p <.001, η p 2 = . 72 , and a suggestive main effect of Type, F(1,30)=3.99, MSE =0.34, p =.055, η p 2 = . 12 , which were qualified by a Load×Type interaction, F(1,30)=12.68, MSE =0.01, p =.001, η p 2 = . 30 , reflecting greater ERs for targets than foils in the 3-back condition, F(1,31)=8.51, MSE =0.04, p =.007, η p 2 = . 22 , but not in the 2-back condition, F <0.5. In addition, a main effect of Congruency, F(1,30)=4.74, MSE <0.01, p =.038, η p 2 = . 14 , revealed that participants performed better in the congruent than in the incongruent condition. In contrast with the dual-coding hypothesis, there was no Congruency×Group interaction, F <0.01, η p 2 < . 01 (95% CIs: .00, .01). To clarify the main effect of Congruency, we performed exploratory ANOVAs separately in each group. This effect was not independently present in controls, F <2.6, or synesthetes, F <2.3. Crucially, the magnitude of the Congruency effect in synesthetes was inconsistent with the prediction of the dual-coding hypothesis, M SynCong =.017, SEM =.011, B =.33. As predicted by the enhanced processing hypothesis, there was a main effect of Group, F(1,30)=6.78, MSE =0.06, p =.014, η p 2 = . 18 (95% CIs: .01, .40), with synesthetes displaying lower ERs than controls (see Fig. 2 A). An inspection of the descriptive statistics in Table 1 suggests that this effect may be driven by especially high error rates for 3-back targets in controls, but importantly there were no Group interactions involving Load or Type, Fs<1, and no other main effects or interactions, Fs<3.8. The main effect of Group was replicated when Color discrimination was included as a covariate, F(1,29)=4.73, MSE =0.05, p =.038, η p 2 = . 14 , with Color discrimination exerting a suggestive independent effect, F(1,29)=3.76, MSE =0.05, p =.062, η p 2 = . 12 , reflecting a positive correlation between color discrimination values and ERs in the n-back task, r =.40, p =.023, r p =.34 (controlling for group). In the non-inducer graphemes task there was a main effect of Load, F(1,30)=42.01, MSE =0.01, p <.001, η p 2 = . 58 , and a Load×Type interaction, F(1,30)=17.72, MSE =0.01, p <.001, η p 2 = . 37 . As with the inducer graphemes, this reflected greater ERs for targets than foils in the 3-back condition, F(1,30)=8.63, MSE =0.02, p =.006, η p 2 = . 23 , but not in the 2-back condition, F <3.1. Crucially, as with the inducer graphemes task, we also found a main effect of Group, F(1,30)=9.82, MSE =0.03, p =.004, η p 2 = . 25 (95% CIs: .03, .46), with synesthetes performing better than controls (see Fig. 2). There were no other effects, Fs<2.3. The Group effect was stable when Color discrimination was treated as a covariate, F(1,29)=7.62, MSE =0.03, p =.010, η p 2 = . 21 , but Color discrimination did not exhibit an independent effect, F <1.8, r p =.24. However, this correlation was suggestive when Group was not included as a covariate, r =.32, p =.072. 2.2.2.2 Response times In the inducer graphemes task, main effects of Load, F(1,30)=4.28, MSE =18,809, p =.047, η p 2 = . 13 , and Type, F(1,30)=12.09, MSE =8,508, p =.002, η p 2 = . 29 , were qualified by Load×Type, F(1,30)=4.54, MSE =1,980, p =.041, η p 2 = . 13 , and Load×Congruency×Type interactions, F(1,30)=6.26, MSE =1,380, p =.018, η p 2 = . 17 . The Congruency×Type interaction was significant in the 2-back condition, F(1,30)=5.60, MSE =843, p =.025, η p 2 = . 16 (the Congruency effect was not significant for foils or targets, Fs<3.5), but not in the 3-back condition, F <1.7. There was also a Congruency×Group interaction, F(1,30)=4.24, MSE =1,882, p =.048, η p 2 = . 12 (95% CIs: .00, .34): the Congruency effect was greater among synesthetes than controls (see Fig. 3 ), but neither effect was independently significant, synesthetes: F <2.4, η 2 =.14 (95% CIs: .00, .42), controls: F <2. 3 Further exploratory ANOVAs revealed that whilst controls and synesthetes did not differ on congruent trials, F <1.6, synesthetes were suggestively slower than controls on incongruent trials, F(1,30)=3.13, MSE =12,555, p =.087, η p 2 = . 09 (95% CIs: .00, .31). Insofar as there was a Congruency effect on ERs and differential congruency effects on RTs, we repeated the ANOVA using efficiency (RT/(1−ER)) as the dependent variable. There were no Congruency or Group effects, Fs<2.9, nor a Congruency×Group interaction, F <1.1. 3 No other effects were found, Fs<3.2. Color discrimination, when included as a covariate, did not exhibit an effect on task performance, F <0.04. In the non-inducer graphemes task, the main effects of Load F(1,30)=5.40, MSE =9,041, p =.027, η p 2 = . 15 , reflecting faster RTs in the 2-back than in the 3-back condition, and Type, F(1,30)=10.07, MSE =5623, p =.003, η p 2 = . 25 , reflecting faster RTs for targets than foils, were replicated, but there were no other effects, Fs<3.2. Again, when color discrimination was included as a covariate, it did not affect task performance, F <0.02. 2.2.2.3 Diffusion modeling Synesthetes displayed significantly lower ERs than controls, but (non-significantly) slower RTs, suggesting the former effect may reflect, at least partially, a speed-accuracy tradeoff. To address this possibility, and to investigate the information processing locus of group effects, we applied the EZ diffusion model (Wagenmakers et al., 2007) to accuracy and RT data. Analyses of the diffusion modeling parameters revealed that synesthetes exhibited greater drift rates, reflecting superior information accumulation, in both the inducer graphemes task, F(1,30)=7.95, MSE =0.02, p =.008, η p 2 = . 21 (95% CIs: .02, .43), and the non-inducer graphemes task, F(1,30)=10.07, MSE =0.01, p =.003, η p 2 = . 25 (95% CIs: .03, .46) (see Fig. 2B). There were no other Group effects for any of the diffusion parameters in either task, Fs<3.8, indicating that greater information accumulation among synesthetes was not enabled by differential decision boundaries or nondecisional slowing of responses. Crucially, there were no Congruency×Group interactions in drift rate, F <2.9, η p 2 = . 09 (95% CIs: .00, .30), boundary separation, F <2.6, η p 2 = . 08 (95% CIs: .00, .29), or nondecision time, F <0.08, η p 2 = . 00 (95% .00, .09). Similarly, including color discrimination as a covariate did not alter the results and it did not exhibit an independent significant effect on any of the parameters, Fs<2.2. EZ checks of the assumptions of the EZ diffusion model revealed that the three model assumptions were violated by 1%, 2%, and 4% of the data, respectively. The results were unaffected when participants with data that violated one or more assumptions were excluded from the analyses. 2.3 Discussion Grapheme–color synesthetes exhibited superior color working memory than non-synesthetes. This effect was comparable in size for inducer ( η p 2 range: .18–.21) and non-inducer ( η p 2 range: .25) graphemes and thus was not specific to synesthetic inducers. Both effects were restricted to drift rate, thereby suggesting that synesthetes’ enhanced performance reflects superior uptake of information and greater stimulus classification when making a response. The difference between synesthetes and controls appears to occur at the stimulus processing stage, which is very much consistent with the enhanced processing hypothesis. Moreover, these results also indicate that synesthetes’ superior performance is independent of a possible speed-accuracy tradeoff because the two groups did not differ in response latencies or any other diffusion parameters. The results provide clear support for the enhanced processing hypothesis and are consistent with previous results showing superior color processing in this population (Arnold et al., 2012; Banissy et al., 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007). We further examined whether enhanced color working memory among synesthetes is driven by superior color discrimination. Although we failed to replicate the finding of superior color discrimination in this group (Banissy et al., 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007), the observed difference was in the predicted direction and the effect size was not markedly lower than that found in previous studies. Indeed, the synesthetes actually performed at a comparable level to those in previous studies, whereas our controls outperformed the controls in previous studies. Importantly, the advantage of synesthesia in color working memory was independent of individual differences in color discrimination, which only suggestively affected performance in the two tasks. The dual-coding hypothesis predicts superior performance for inducer graphemes among synesthetes, particularly inducers that are congruently-colored. We observed two results relating to this prediction. First, in ERs, there was a main effect of Congruency on ERs across both Groups. This somewhat unexpected finding may have resulted from the large proportion of congruent trials in the inducer grapheme task. We included equivalent proportions of congruent and incongruent trials, which is known to increase the magnitude of the Stroop effect (Macleod, 1991), in order to augment our ability to detect a synesthetic Congruency effect. However, given the proportion of congruent trials, each of the individual congruent grapheme–color pairs were presented more frequently than each of the individual incongruent grapheme–color pairs, participants may have implicitly learned to associate graphemes and colors that were more frequently paired than those that were paired less frequently in what amounts to a contingency learning artifact (see, e.g., Schmidt & Besner, 2008). However, our assessment of whether the synesthetic Congruency effect supports the prediction of the dual-coding hypothesis using the Bayes factor (Dienes, 2011) was restricted to synesthetes and thus is not hindered by this confound. The corresponding Bayes factor was .33 and is consistent with the null hypothesis that there was no Congruency effect in response accuracy in synesthetes. Synesthetes did display a greater congruency effect in response latencies than controls. Crucially, this effect reflected suggestively slower RTs for incongruent trials among synesthetes, but no advantage for congruent trials. This result is clearly at odds with the dual-coding hypothesis (Paivio, 1969, 1986), which predicts a specific advantage for congruent trials. Rather, it seems that color photisms on incongruent trials elicit greater response conflict and thereby delay responses whereas photisms on congruent trials neither advantage nor disadvantage working memory performance. 4 It could be objected that because digit-color consistency was only verified in a subset of our synesthetes, the remaining synesthetes might not exhibit robust congruency effects and, in turn, diminish the magnitude of Congruency effects in this group. We investigated this possibility by repeating the analyses with these two subgroups comprising the two levels of a between-groups independent variable; there were no differences between the two groups in the magnitude of Congruency effects in response accuracy or latency, nor any of the diffusion parameters, Fs<3.6. 4 Cumulatively, these results are inconsistent with the dual-coding hypothesis. 3 Experiment 2 Experiment 1 provided support for the enhanced processing hypothesis but did not constitute a stringent test of the dual-coding hypothesis because participants maintained colors, not graphemes, in working memory. To more clearly test the prediction that synesthetic colors facilitate maintenance of graphemes in working memory, participants completed the same n-back tasks, but responded as to whether the current grapheme had previously been presented in the sequence. If a dual-coding mechanism contributes to working memory maintenance in synesthesia, then synesthetes should exhibit superior working memory for inducer graphemes, particularly those that are congruently-colored, than non-synesthetes, but not for non-inducer graphemes. 3.1 Method 3.1.1 Participants Ten controls (9 female, M Age =24.4, SD =1.58) and 10 grapheme–color synesthetes (9 female, M Age =22.4, SD =4.2), recruited from the University of Oxford, participated. Nine synesthetes and 8 controls took part in Experiment 1; the two experiments were conducted 2months apart. The same synesthetes were included in this study because it is challenging to recruit new synesthetes; the same controls were included because we wanted the groups to be relatively matched on any performance advantages conferred by participating in multiple working memory experiments. Digit–color consistency information was available for 4 synesthetes. The procedure and analysis was the same as that reported in Experiment 1. Digit–color associations were recorded on two separate days separated by 42days (range: 3–117, SD =53) and all synesthetes displayed consistency values (range: .11–.56; M =.24, SD =.14) considered to be diagnostic of synesthesia (Eagleman et al., 2007); consistency was unrelated to the number of days between grapheme–color association tests, r s =.00. 3.1.2 Design and procedure Participants completed the same inducer and non-inducer graphemes n-back tasks as in Experiment 1 with two changes: (1) participants were instructed to respond whether the current grapheme matched that which was presented two or three steps back in the sequence; and (2) the non-inducer graphemes task used achromatic stimuli. 3.2 Results 3.2.1 Error rates There was a main effect of Load in the inducer graphemes task, F(1,18)=24.12, MSE =0.02, p <.001, η p 2 = . 57 , with participants making fewer errors in the 2-back than in the 3-back condition. Crucially, there were no main effects of Congruency, F <0.5, or Group, F <0.7, or a Congruency×Group interaction, F <0.07, η p 2 = . 00 (95% CIs: .00, .12) (see Fig. 4 A). As in Experiment 1, the synesthetes’ Congruency effect, M SynCong =–.004, SEM =.012, was inconsistent with the prediction of the dual-coding hypothesis, B =.07; there were no other effects, Fs<2.7. In the non-inducer graphemes task, main effects of Load, F(1,18)=38.91, MSE =0.01, p <.001, η p 2 = . 68 , and Type, F(1,18)=7.92, MSE =0.02, p =.011, η p 2 = . 31 , were qualified by a Load×Type interaction, F(1,18)=12.12, MSE =0.01, p =.003, η p 2 = . 40 . This was driven by lower ERs for foils than targets in the 3-back condition, F(1,19)=12.72, MSE =0.02, p =.002, η p 2 = . 40 , but not in the 2-back condition, F <1. There was no main effect of Group, F <1.3, or any other effects, Fs<1.3. The dual-coding hypothesis predicts that synesthetes should display superior maintenance for congruently-colored graphemes than non-inducer graphemes. We examined this by including congruent inducer graphemes and non-inducer graphemes as the two levels of a Congruency factor in an ANOVA that also included Load, Type, and Group as independent variables. This analysis again failed to find a Congruency×Group interaction, F <0.4, η p 2 = . 02 (95% CIs: .00, .24). 3.2.2 Response times In the inducer graphemes task, there were main effects of Load, F(1,18)=4.99, MSE =17,914, p =.038, η p 2 = . 22 , reflecting slower RTs in the 3-back condition, and Type, F(1,18)=9.07, MSE =8,531, p =.007, η p 2 = . 34 , reflecting slower RTs for foils. Crucially, in contrast with dual coding theory, there were neither main effects of Congruency, F <0.5, or Group, F <0.1, nor a Congruency×Group interaction, F <0.1, η p 2 = . 00 (95% CIs: .00, .00) (see Fig. 4B). There was a Load×Type×Group interaction, F(1,18)=4.67, MSE =3,310, p =.044, η p 2 = . 21 ; controls exhibited a numerically, but non-significantly, greater Load effect than synesthetes on foils, Load×Group: F <2.4, but not on targets, F <0.01. There was also a Load×Congruency×Type interaction, F(1,18)=5.71, MSE =1,685, p =.028, η p 2 = . 24 , reflecting different Congruency×Type interactions in the different load conditions; again, neither was independently significant, Fs<3.4. There were no other effects, Fs<2.9. In the non-inducer graphemes task, there was a main effect of Load, F(1,18)=6.65, MSE =10,123, p =.019, η p 2 = . 27 , reflecting slower RTs in the 3-back condition, and a suggestive effect of Type, F(1,18)=3.54, MSE =6,106, p =.076, η p 2 = . 16 . There was no effect of Group, F <0.1, or any other effects, Fs<3. When RTs for congruent and non-inducer graphemes were contrasted in an ANOVA, there was again no Congruency×Group interaction, F <0.1, η p 2 = . 01 (95% CIs: .00, .15). 3.2.3 Diffusion modeling It is possible that response accuracy and latency measures are not sufficiently sensitive to detect Group effects or Congruency×Group interactions in the inducer grapheme n-back task. To investigate this possibility, we applied diffusion modeling to the data as in Experiment 1. Again, there were no main effects of Group on drift rate, F <0.8, boundary separation, F <0.4, or nondecision time, F <0.1. Crucially, there were also no Congruency×Group interactions on drift rate, F <0.8, η p 2 = . 04 (95% CIs: .00, .29), boundary separation, F <0.1, η p 2 = . 00 (95% CIs: .00, .09), or nondecision time, F <1.8, η p 2 = . 09 (95% CIs: .00, .36). In the non-inducer graphemes task, there were no main effects of Group on any of the diffusion parameters, Fs<1.9. However, there was a suggestive Load×Group interaction on nondecision time, F(1,18)=3.51, p =.077, η p 2 = . 16 (95% CIs: .00, .43), reflecting a greater Load effect among controls, F(1,9)=15.81, p =.003, η p 2 = . 64 (95% CIs: .12, .80) than synesthetes, F <0.1. Interestingly, there was a Load×Group interaction on boundary separation in the non-inducer graphemes task, F(1,18)=16.23, MSE <0.01, p <.001, η p 2 = . 47 (95% CIs: .12, .67), which was qualified by a Load×Type×Group interaction, F(1,18)=4.61, MSE <0.01, p =.046, η p 2 = . 20 (95% CIs: .00, .47). Controls displayed numerically higher boundary separation for foils than targets in the two-back condition, but lower values for foils than targets in the three-back condition, whereas synesthetes displayed the converse pattern. The Load×Type interaction did not achieve significance in either group, Fs<2.9. As in the inducer graphemes task, there was a Load×Group interaction on nondecision time, F(1,18)=8.23, p =.010, η p 2 = . 31 (95% CIs: .02, .56), again reflecting a greater Load effect among controls, F(1,9)=38.85, p <.001, η p 2 = . 81 (95% CIs: .38, .89), than synesthetes, F <0.4. When diffusion parameters for congruent inducer and non-inducer graphemes were compared, there were no Congruency×Group interactions on drift rate: F <0.4, η p 2 = . 02 (95% CIs: .00, .24), boundary separation: F <0.1, η p 2 = . 01 (95% CIs: .00, .16), or nondecision time: F <0.8, η p 2 = . 04 (95% CIs: .00, .29). There were no other Group effects for any of the diffusion parameters in either task, Fs<3.6. As in Experiment 1, violations of the three assumptions of the EZ diffusion model were infrequent: 8%, 7%, and 3%, respectively. When the participants with data that violated these assumptions were excluded from the analyses, the Load×Group interaction on nondecision time was non-significant, F <0.4, as was the Load×Type×Group interaction on boundary separation, F <0.3, whereas the other interactions reported above remained significant. 3.3 Discussion Grapheme–color synesthetes and non-synesthetes did not systematically differ in grapheme working memory. The central prediction of the dual-coding account is that synesthetes should display a greater stimulus-photism color Congruency effect, reflecting superior performance on congruent trials, than controls. This Congruency×Group interaction was not found in ERs, RTs, or three diffusion parameters. 5 As in Experiment 1, we investigated whether Congruency effects varied as a function of whether synesthetes’ consistency had been verified or not (cf. Footnote 4). Again, there were no differences between these two groups, Fs<3.0. 5 In a series of exploratory analyses contrasting these dependent variables in the congruent and non-inducer conditions, we similarly found no Congruency×Group interactions. The fact that the mean effect size for this interaction across the different analyses was .02 strongly indicates that our inability to detect this effect is not due to insufficient statistical power. This finding is crucial because effect size is independent of sample size (e.g., Fritz, Morris, & Richler, 2012) and thus even with a substantially larger sample size, this effect size would still not yield a statistically significant result. Consistent with this, the computed Bayes factors for the synesthetic Congruency effect in ERs (.07) provides substantial evidence for the null hypothesis. Further evidence that this study was not underpowered is marshaled by two other studies that did not observe superior digit span performance for inducer stimuli in synesthetes despite having larger sample sizes than the present study (N =26 [controls: n =20; synesthetes: n =6]; Gross et al., 2011; N =44 [synesthetes]; Rothen & Meier, 2010). It could be argued that synesthetic phosphenes on incongruent trials may afford cues that also aid memory and thus we should not expect congruency effects. However, such an interpretation still predicts a dual-coding driven overall advantage in inducer grapheme working memory among synesthetes, which we did not observe. The only observed Group difference was a larger effect of working memory load on nondecision time in controls than synesthetes. This suggests that the higher working memory load did not tax encoding or motor preparatory processes as much in synesthetes and points to a suggestive advantage in this group that is specific to nondecisional processes. Crucially, this effect was only reliably observed for non-inducer graphemes and thus does not point to any specific advantage conferred by the online experience of synesthesia on working memory among synesthetes. The failure to find support for the dual-coding hypothesis is consistent with our inability to detect an advantage among synesthetes for congruent graphemes in Experiment 1. Synesthetic congruency effects have been inconsistently observed in episodic memory tasks (Gibson et al., 2012; Radvansky et al., 2011; Rothen & Meier, 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007) even though they have been repeatedly observed in selective attention tasks with inducer stimuli (Dixon et al., 2000, 2004; Wollen & Ruggiero, 1983). Cumulatively, these results indicate that experiencing ancillary color photisms during the encoding of graphemes does not confer any benefit in maintaining and updating grapheme sequences in working memory or manipulating such information in immediate memory (Gross et al., 2011; Rothen & Meier, 2010). As with those of Experiment 1, these results are therefore inconsistent with the dual-coding hypothesis as applied to working memory in synesthesia. 4 Experiment 3 One potential confound in Experiment 1 is differential color familiarity across groups. The stimulus colors were the same colors that synesthetes experience on a regular basis whereas these colors may have been relatively novel for non-synesthetes (e.g., mauve) and thus difficult to verbally code or maintain in working memory. In turn, differential stimulus color familiarity may have conferred a performance advantage for synesthetes and produced the observed group differences. A further potential limitation of Experiments 1 and 2 is that synesthesia was confirmed by self-report in an interview and not with behavioral measures of automaticity or consistency of grapheme–color associations, which are widely regarded as markers of genuine synesthesia (Ward, 2013). This experiment circumvents these limitations by replicating Experiment 1 using canonical colors that would be equally familiar to both groups and by verifying the consistency of synesthetes’ grapheme–color associations. 4.1 Method 4.1.1 Participants Eight controls (six female, M Age =25.38, SD =4.21) and eight grapheme–color synesthetes (six female, M Age =25.13, SD =3.80), recruited from the University of Oxford, participated. None had participated in Experiments 1 or 2. Digit–color consistency information was available for all 8 synesthetes. The procedure and analysis was the same as that reported in Experiments 1 and 2. Digit–color associations were recorded on two separate days separated by 40days (range: 9–100, SD =32) and all synesthetes displayed consistency values (range: .17–.30; M =.22, SD =.04) considered to be diagnostic of synesthesia (Eagleman et al., 2007); consistency was unrelated to the number of days between grapheme–color association tests, r s =−.002. 4.1.2 Design and procedure The non-inducer graphemes task of Experiment 1 was used in this experiment but grapheme colors were comprised of eight canonical colors (blue, orange, red, yellow, pink, purple, brown, and green) instead of synesthetes’ photism colors. Participants completed two practice and six experimental blocks (three 2-back and three 3-back). The experiment was conducted by a different experimenter than in Experiments 1 and 2. 4.2 Results The data of one synesthete, who was a RT outlier in three of the four conditions (Zs>1.96), were excluded from the analyses. 4.2.1 Error rates A mixed-model ANOVA revealed a main effect of Load, F(1,13)=47.34, MSE =0.01, p <.001, η p 2 = . 79 , reflecting lower error rates in the 2-back than in the 3-back condition. There was no main effect of Group, F <1.4, η p 2 = . 10 (95% CIs: .00, .40), or any other effects, Fs<1.6. 4.2.2 Response times We again found a main effect of Load, F(1,13)=11.35, MSE =5,267, p =.005, η p 2 = . 47 , with faster RTs in the 2-back than in the 3-back condition, but also a main effect of Group, F(1,13)=10.94, MSE =56,194, p =.006, η p 2 = . 46 (95% CIs: .05, .68), reflecting faster RTs among synesthetes than controls (see Fig. 5 A). There were no other effects, Fs<3.7. 4.2.3 Diffusion modeling The analyses revealed that the Group effect was present in nondecision time (T er), F(1,13)=17.46, MSE =0.03, p =.001, η p 2 = . 57 (95% CIs: .13, .75), with synesthetes displaying lower values than controls (see Fig. 5B). There was no effect of Group on drift rate, F <1.7, η p 2 = . 11 (95% CIs: .05, .42), or boundary separation, F <0.1, η p 2 = . 00 (95% CIs: .00, .07), and no other Group effects, Fs<4.6. Violations of the three EZ diffusion model assumptions occurred in 0%, 7%, and 3% of the data, respectively, and the results were not affected when participants with data that violated these assumptions were excluded from the analyses. 4.3 Discussion As in Experiment 1, synesthetes displayed superior color working memory than controls, even though the stimulus set was comprised of canonical colors. In Experiment 1, this effect was found in drift rate, suggesting that synesthetes displayed superior information accumulation and stimulus classification, whereas in this experiment it was present in nondecision time, suggesting that synesthetes displayed more efficient visual encoding (Wagenmakers et al., 2007). This discrepancy in the locus of group differences across experiments may be due to differential implicit emphasis of latency (Experiment 1) or accuracy (Experiment 3) by the different experimenters (Pachella, 1974) and concomitant differences in stimulus classification or visual encoding, respectively. Nevertheless, these results extend those of Experiment 1 and indicate that superior color working memory among synesthetes is neither an artifact of increased color familiarity nor reflective of enhanced working memory for colors that is specific to concurrent colors. Moreover, this Experiment reveals that superior color working memory can be replicated in an independent sample of participants whose synesthesia has been confirmed by behavioral testing. An alternative explanation for enhanced color working memory among synesthetes is that color stimuli implicitly triggered numerical representations, which, in turn, aided maintenance of color sequences in working memory, as would be predicted by dual-coding theory (see, e.g., Rothen et al., 2012). Multiple studies have documented implicit, and even explicitly, bidirectionality in synesthetes (Cohen Kadosh, Cohen Kadosh, & Henik, 2007; Cohen Kadosh & Henik, 2006; Cohen Kadosh, Tzelgov, & Henik, 2008; Cohen Kadosh et al., 2005; Gebuis, Nijboer, & Van der Smagt, 2009; Gevers, Imbo, Cohen Kadosh, Fias, & Hartsuiker, 2010; Johnson, Jepma, & de Jong, 2007; Knoch, Gianotti, Mohr, & Brugger, 2005) and so this explanation is plausible. However, a number of results in this study are at odds with this interpretation. If bidirectionality is driving enhanced color working memory among synesthetes, performance should be superior for stimulus colors (e.g., navy blue) that are close in color space to a color photism for a particular numeral (e.g., light blue) than for stimulus colors that are greater in distance from the nearest photism color. We tested this prediction by computing the Euclidean distance between the stimulus color on each trial and the nearest photism color (based on the respective participant’s digit–color associations) and included color distance as a predictor of performance. For each participant, we performed multivariate linear regression on RTs and binary multivariate logistic regression on accuracy (incorrect=0; correct=1) with Load (2- vs. 3- back block), Trial type (foil vs. target), and Stimulus-photism color distance as predictors (forced entry regression method). The sample size of each regression analysis was 273, corresponding to the number of trials (excluding practice and the 1st 2 trials in 2-back blocks and the 1st 3 trials in 3-back blocks for which participants cannot make 2-back or 3-back judgments) (for a similar approach, see Notebaert & Verguts, 2007). In line with our results, Load significantly predicted RTs in 3 out of 7 participants (betas [M ± SE]: 79±30) and accuracy in 5 participants, −0.80±0.35. Trial type did not predict RTs in a single participant, −30±10, but did predict accuracy in 2 participants, −0.47±0.24. Crucially, Color distance predicted both RTs and accuracy in only a single synesthete, RT: 0.10±0.14; accuracy: 0.01±0.01. These results corroborate the effects of Load on performance (e.g., higher load being associated with slower RTs and more errors), and Trial type to a lesser extent, but further indicate that the distance between the stimulus color and the nearest photism color does not reliably predict performance. These results, in turn, strongly suggest that superior color working memory in synesthesia is not driven by bidirectionality. Two further results are inconsistent with a bidirectionality account. If superior color working memory in synesthesia were driven by bidirectionality, we should expect larger effects in Experiment 1 than 3, because the former included synesthetic photism colors, which should implicitly trigger grapheme representations more than canonical colors. We did not observe this result. Furthermore, number–color associations are typically more robust in synesthetes than color–number associations; at the very least, the size of their impact on behavior is roughly equivalent (Gebuis et al., 2009). Thus, if superior color working memory were driven by bidirectionality, we would still expect synesthetes to display superior grapheme working memory (at least for congruent trials) than controls. Again, we did not observe this result in Experiment 2. These results strongly indicate that bidirectionality is not driving superior color working memory among synesthetes. 5 General discussion This study examined whether grapheme–color synesthesia confers an advantage on visual working memory and sought to discriminate between two possible explanations for this effect. Synesthetes displayed superior color, but not grapheme, working memory than non-synesthetes. Crucially, this effect was present (and comparable in size) irrespective of whether the colored grapheme elicited synesthesia, thus demonstrating that it is not specific to the online experience of synesthesia. Furthermore, we show that enhanced color working memory among synesthetes is neither an artifact of superior color discrimination nor increased familiarity of stimulus colors. Finally, we replicated the principal effect of superior color working memory in an independent sample of synesthetes. Cumulatively, these results indicate that synesthetes exhibit enhanced dimension-specific visual working memory. The current results significantly extend previous research on episodic memory advantages among synesthetes (Gross et al., 2011; Radvansky et al., 2011; Rothen & Meier, 2010; Rothen et al., 2012; Yaro & Ward, 2007) by showing that superior memory in this group is not restricted to long-term storage or retrieval and is already present in working memory. The results are notably consistent with those of Yaro and Ward (2007), who found that grapheme–color synesthetes exhibited greater color recognition memory than non-synesthetes, even for stimuli that do not elicit synesthetic color photisms (see also Rothen & Meier, 2010). Indeed, it is plausible that enhanced color working memory subserves superior color recognition memory in this population. Recently, Arnold et al. (2012) showed that grapheme–color synesthetes were more precise than controls at recalling the color and luminance of a colored circle using a modifiable color patch. Insofar as participants completed the recollection task only 500ms after stimulus presentation, this result is indicative of superior color working memory among synesthetes and thereby bolsters the present results. One limitation of their study is that there were no time restrictions in the color recollection task and thus synesthetes may have outperformed controls by spending more time on the task. The present results, however, cannot be explained by this confound. However, unlike in some episodic memory tasks (Gross et al., 2011; Radvansky et al., 2011; Yaro & Ward, 2007), synesthetes did not display superior working memory for inducer stimuli. We did observe a greater congruency effect (slower RTs for incongruent than congruent inducer graphemes) when participants were attending to grapheme colors. However, this effect was due to slower response latencies for incongruently-colored graphemes, plausibly the result of increased response conflict. Across experiments, synesthetes did not display a processing advantage for congruent graphemes relative to controls and the effect sizes for these effects were consistently near zero, with correspondingly low Bayes factors for the synesthetic Congruency effect in response accuracy, both of which support the null hypothesis (Dienes, 2011). These results are also partly consistent with those of Radvansky et al. (2011), who did not observe a specific advantage for congruently-colored words than achromatic words among synesthetes and also found that synesthetes’ advantage in word recall was not specific to congruent stimuli. Importantly, these results go against a dual-coding (Paivio, 1969, 1986) account of working memory in synesthesia (see also Yaro & Ward, 2007). At the same time, they are consistent with results showing that synesthetes do not reliably display superior immediate memory (Gross et al., 2011; Rothen & Meier, 2010) for inducer stimuli and do not reliably exhibit congruency effects in memory tasks (Rothen & Meier, 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007). One possible explanation for the inconsistent observation of congruency effects on memory in synesthesia is that synesthetes may not consistently encode the grapheme and color in separate slave systems. For instance, both may be maintained in a phonological loop, and thus dual-coding benefits would not be expected. Alternatively, it may be that color photisms, which do not affect memory in the same way as sensory experiences (e.g., Arnold et al., 2012), do not confer an auxiliary coding advantage in working memory or short-term memory for graphemes in the same way as concurrent sensory experiences do (see also Mastroberardino et al., 2008; Rothen & Meier, 2010). Further research is needed to discriminate between these possibilities. The observation that synesthetes do not have superior grapheme working memory is noteworthy in two other ways. First, this result strongly suggests that the observed differences in color working memory are not artifacts of differential motivation across groups. Synesthetes are cognizant of the fact that they are a special population and there is always an elevated risk that superior performance in this group can be attributed to increased motivation. Accordingly, insofar as greater motivation should lead to better performance across tasks, our finding that superior working memory among synesthetes is specific to color strongly discounts a differential motivation explanation (see also Gross et al., 2011; Radvansky et al., 2011). Second, the differing results across attended visual dimensions provide refined information regarding their putative neurocognitive locus. If synesthetes displayed enhanced domain-general working memory, this might suggest superior frontal modulation of fusiform gyrus and visual cortex in this population (Gazzaley & Nobre, 2012). Instead, the observed dissociation between color and grapheme working memory more strongly suggests a low-level mechanism related to enhanced color processing (Yaro & Ward, 2007). A further piece of evidence that isolates the locus of enhanced working memory in synesthetes to color processing and not domain-general working memory is that we did not observe Load×Group interactions on color working memory. That is, increased working memory load taxed performance to a relatively similar degree in the two groups. This suggests that synesthetes have superior baseline working memory and that increasing working memory load has a similarly deleterious effect on performance in synesthetes and non-synesthetes. According to the enhanced processing account, color information is encoded more strongly in color synesthetes leading to higher fidelity color representations and, in turn, superior maintenance in working memory. This interpretation is consistent with multiple studies showing enhanced color (Arnold et al., 2012; Banissy et al., 2009; Yaro & Ward, 2007) and enhanced visual processing in the parvocellular pathway (Barnett et al., 2008) in color synesthetes. More broadly, given these documented differences between synesthetes and controls in visual processing, the current results provide further evidence for the proposal that brain regions responsible for processing and representing information are similarly responsible for the maintenance of that information in working memory (Jonides et al., 2005; Postle, 2006; Serences et al., 2009). Enhanced color working memory among color synesthetes may be subserved by hyperexcitability in primary visual cortex (Terhune, Tai, Cowey, Popescu, & Cohen Kadosh, 2011). Hyperexcitability may lead to the pooling of neurons in primary visual cortex tuned to stimulus color, which may amplify this feature or facilitate the reduction or exclusion of internal and external noise, respectively (Lu & Dosher, 2009), thereby producing a more stable representation. A corollary of this account is that synesthetes will display enhanced modality- or dimension-specific working memory pertaining to the modality of their concurrent (see also Simner, Mayo, & Spiller, 2009). For example, we would expect that mirror-touch synesthetes will display superior working memory for tactile information, but not for color information (see also Banissy et al., 2009), or that spatial-sequence synesthetes (Cohen Kadosh, Gertner, & Terhune, 2012) will display superior spatial working memory. Enhanced color processing in synesthetes is likely to play a more fundamental role in the development and maintenance of synesthesia. Insofar as individual differences in working memory predict associative learning (Lewandowsky, 2011), enhanced color working memory may subserve learning of inducer–color pairs in early development, such as during the exposure to grapheme–color pairs (e.g., Witthoft & Winawer, 2013); indeed, synesthetes are better at learning novel symbol-color pairs than non-synesthetes (Rothen & Meier, 2010). Superior coding of colors may also be reflected in better color perceptual memory and thereby contribute to consolidation, and greater consistency, of extant inducer–color pairs (Yaro & Ward, 2007). However, a challenge for this account will be to determine the mechanisms underlying the specificity of synesthesia, that is, why an individual will develop grapheme–color, but not sound–color, associations, both of which are frequently reported by synesthetes (e.g., Niccolai, Jennes, Stoerig, & Van Leeuwen, 2012). One non-competing alternative explanation of our results is that grapheme–color synesthetes display broader, enhanced processing in the parvocellular visual pathway (Barnett et al., 2008; Rothen et al., 2012), which enables processing of color and high contrast stimuli (e.g., Brown, 2009). This hypothesis more readily explains synesthetes’ superior memory for achromatic visual stimuli that do not elicit color photisms (Rothen & Meier, 2010) than dual-coding and enhanced color processing accounts. However, a parvocellular-specific processing advantage should still have produced an advantage in grapheme working memory in synesthetes, which we did not observe to a great degree. In summary, grapheme–color synesthetes displayed greater color working memory than non-synesthetes, whereas the two groups did not differ in grapheme working memory. Such superior color working memory in synesthetes is not attributable to superior color discrimination, the online experience of synesthesia, or color familiarity. Cumulatively, these results demonstrate superior dimension-specific working memory in grapheme–color synesthesia, which may be subserved by enhanced color processing in this population. Beyond synesthesia, these results provide a clear demonstration of how visual working memory can be constrained in a dimension-specific manner and supplies further evidence for a close relationship between sensory processing and the maintenance of sensory information in working memory.

Highlights • 6-month-olds consider others’ mental states when predicting their actions. • We use sensorimotor alpha suppression as a neural correlate of action prediction. • Infants predict an action only when the person’s belief should lead them to act. Abstract Successful mindreading entails both the ability to think about what others know or believe, and to use this knowledge to generate predictions about how mental states will influence behavior. While previous studies have demonstrated that young infants are sensitive to others’ mental states, there continues to be much debate concerning how to characterize early theory of mind abilities. In the current study, we asked whether 6-month-old infants appreciate the causal role that beliefs play in action. Specifically, we tested whether infants generate action predictions that are appropriate given an agent’s current belief. We exploited a novel, neural indication of action prediction: motor cortex activation as measured by sensorimotor alpha suppression, to ask whether infants would generate differential predictions depending on an agent’s belief. After first verifying our paradigm and measure with a group of adult participants, we found that when an agent had a false belief that a ball was in the box, motor activity indicated that infants predicted she would reach for the box, but when the agent had a false belief that a ball was not in the box, infants did not predict that she would act. In both cases, infants based their predictions on what the agent, rather than the infant, believed to be the case, suggesting that by 6months of age, infants can exploit their sensitivity to other minds for action prediction. Keywords Infants Theory of mind False belief EEG Sensorimotor alpha suppression 1 Introduction Accurately predicting what others will do is mediated by our understanding that their actions are driven, not necessarily by what we think or know to be the case, but by what they think and believe. Despite being fundamental for successful social interaction, the ability to generate action predictions on the basis of others’ perspectives has long been thought to be a protracted developmental achievement (Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001). Successful action prediction will often require at least three different stages of computation. First, one needs to understand that others’ actions are goal-directed and identify what goal is motivating their behavior (e.g. she wants to get the ball). They then need to consider what that person knows or believes about their goal (e.g. she thinks her ball is in the cupboard). Finally, they need to use their representations of the other’s goals and beliefs to generate a prediction about how these elements will influence her subsequent behavior (Dennett, 1989) (e.g. she will search for her ball in the cupboard). In recent years, this view of theory of mind acquisition as progressing through stages over the first few years of life has been challenged by the discovery that, even in the first year after birth, infants not only readily interpret others’ actions as goal-directed (Gergely, Nadasdy, Csibra, & Biro, 1995; Woodward, 1998), but appear to appreciate that goal-directed behavior is modulated by an agent’s belief (Luo, 2011). When presented with scenarios in which an agent acts either consistently or inconsistently with how their past experience should lead them to act, preverbal infants respond with increased attention to the inconsistently-behaving agent (Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005; Surian, Caldi, & Sperber, 2007). Furthermore, even infants as young as 7months appear to spontaneously encode events from other’s perspectives, reacting with increased interest when a ball which an agent should believe to be present is revealed to be absent (Kovacs, Teglas, & Endress, 2010). These studies suggest that infants are sensitive to others’ perspectives and resulting beliefs (Rakoczy, 2012). However, there is much debate concerning to what extent this demonstrated sensitivity to others’ beliefs should be interpreted as a genuine understanding of belief. Recent theoretical papers have highlighted the various ways in which the underlying cognitive states that drive infant’s behavior on non-verbal false belief tasks might fall short of a true understanding of belief (Apperly & Butterfill, 2011; Rakoczy, 2012). For example, Rakoczy (2012) discusses the possibility that infants may be relying on subdoxastic states rather than propositional attitudes when reacting to the outcomes of events in looking-time paradigms. One essential difference is whether or not such mental states can be inferentially integrated. According to Rakoczy, a true understanding of belief requires that one appreciate that a belief is related to other mental states (e.g. goals), and to outputs (e.g. actions). It is the integration of different states (e.g. goals and beliefs) and an appreciation of the consequences of these states for action, that is central to Dennett’s so-called ‘Intentional Stance’ which he proposes we adopt when explaining and predicting the behavior of others (Dennett, 1989). However, while an appreciation of the relationship between beliefs and other mental states, or beliefs and action, seems central to the concept of belief, we do not know whether young infants have an appreciation of these relationships. For example, in Kovacs and colleagues study, belief sensitivity manifested as interference: infants own representation of the location of a hidden object seemed to be influenced by what they knew of the others’ representation of the object (Kovacs et al., 2010). While studies with young infants clearly provide evidence that infants are sensitive to others’ mental states (Rakoczy, 2012), they do not provide evidence that infants understand, for example, that beliefs play a causal role in action because they do not show that infants expect that a particular belief will lead to a particular action outcome. This is, in part, because looking-time provides only an indication that infants are sensitive to some event, and cannot provide evidence that infants expected that a particular outcome would result from that event (Haith, 1998; Wellman, 2011). There is much contradictory evidence concerning the extent to which infants might understand the relationship between mental states and subsequent behavior. For example, some have suggested that infants’ early sensitivity to others’ goals does not support a prediction concerning how these goals will influence action (Daum, Attig, Gunawan, Prinz, & Gredebäck, 2012), whereas other evidence suggests that infants can generate predictions concerning what others will do given a particular goal, at around the same time as they demonstrate this understanding in their looking-time response (Southgate & Begus, 2013; Southgate, Johnson, El Karoui, & Csibra, 2010). In the current study, we sought evidence that, at around the same age as infants demonstrate a sensitivity to others’ beliefs (Kovacs et al., 2010), they also appreciate the causal role that beliefs play in action. Specifically, we asked whether 6-month-old infants generate action predictions that are appropriate given a false belief held by an agent. Two approaches to measuring action predictions in preverbal infants have been used in recent years. Firstly, eye tracking has revealed that infants make saccades towards the end point of an ongoing event, suggesting that they are able to generate predictions concerning how the event will culminate. For example, when infants see a hand reaching towards a previously chosen and unchosen object, they make anticipatory saccades in the direction of the previously chosen object, presumably because they predict that the hand will again approach the same object (Cannon & Woodward, 2012). While eye tracking is an extremely useful measure of action prediction, it may also have its limitations. For example, in order to demonstrate their ability to generate action predictions, infants need to disengage from a moving stimuli (e.g. a hand) and move their eyes towards a static one (e.g. an object that the hand is approaching). This ability to visually disengage from an interesting stimulus, thought to reflect endogenous attention control, continues to improve across the first year of life, with infants at 7months being slower to disengage than infants at 14months (Elsabbagh et al., 2013). Thus, while an absence of anticipatory saccades is commonly interpreted as an inability to generate predictions (Cannon & Woodward, 2012; Falck-Ytter, Gredeback, & Hofsten, 2006; Kanakogi & Itakura, 2011), it might also reflect infant’s immature visual disengagement. An alternative approach to measuring action prediction in infancy thus relies not on eye movements, but on a likely neural correlate of action prediction, motor cortex activation. It is well known that areas of an observer’s motor system are recruited when generating predictions about others’ actions (Cross, Stadler, Parkinson, Schütz-Bosbach, & Prinz, 2011; Kilner, Vargas, Duval, Blakemore, & Sirigu, 2004; Schubotz, 2007; Stadler et al., 2012), and this phenomenon has also been demonstrated in infants (Southgate & Begus, 2013; Southgate, Johnson, Osborne, & Csibra, 2009; Southgate et al., 2010;). One measure of motor activation is a decrease in the resting-state alpha rhythm, recordable on the EEG, over sensorimotor cortex (Marshall & Meltzoff, 2011). For example, 9-month-old infants exhibit a significant decrease in alpha amplitude over sensorimotor cortex (implying motor activation) when they are presented with an image of an object that experience has taught them implies an impending action (Southgate & Begus, 2013), demonstrating that motor cortex activation can serve as a useful correlate of action prediction in infants. That motor cortex activation may be a more sensitive measure of infants abilities to generate action predictions is suggested by the fact that, despite not generating anticipatory eye movements towards the target object of a mechanical claw (Cannon & Woodward, 2012), even younger infants nevertheless exhibit motor activation when they observe a claw in the presence of an object that it had previously approached (but not when the claw is in the presence of an object that it had previously ignored)(Southgate & Begus, 2013). Here, we measured motor activation to investigate whether infants would appropriately predict when someone with a false belief will and will not reach for a box that they falsely believe either does, or does not, contain a desired object. Rather than asking where someone with a false belief will search as is typical with older children (Wimmer & Perner, 1983), measuring motor activation allows us to ask simply whether infants expect that the agent will act at all. To this end, we designed two false belief scenarios that generated different action predictions. In one case, an agent falsely believes a ball to be in a box in front of her (she was absent when the ball rolled away) and so, if infants understand that she has a false belief about the situation, and the consequences of this false belief for her subsequent action, they should predict that she will reach for the box. In the second case, the same agent falsely believes that the ball is not in the box (she was absent when the ball returned). If the infant understands that she has a false belief, and the consequences of this belief for her action, they should not expect that she will reach for the box. These two conditions make opposing predictions about activity in the motor system. In the case where the agent falsely believes the ball to be present (herein called the A+O− condition, where the agent believes the ball to be present but the observer knows the ball to be absent), an expectation of action should lead to an increase in motor activation, as measured by a decrease in sensorimotor alpha suppression. In the case where the agent falsely believes the ball to be absent (herein called the A−O+ condition, where the agent believes the ball to be absent but the observer knows the ball to be present), no expectation of action should result in no increase in motor activation and no decrease in sensorimotor alpha suppression. In Experiment 1, we first verified our measure and design with a group of adult participants. In Experiment 2, we tested a group of 6-month-old infants. 2 Experiment 1 In Experiment 1, we tested a group of adult participants in order to confirm that our neural measure of action prediction yielded the expected results. Adults were presented with two kinds of false belief trials in which either the agent had a false belief that a desired ball was inside a box in front of her, or she had a false belief that the ball was not inside the box. Although her belief was false in both cases (since the observing adult knew that the ball was actually not inside the box, or was inside the box, respectively), the observer’s expectation that the agent would act should differ depending on the agent’s belief. In the case where the agent falsely believes the ball to be in the box (A+O), the observer should expect that she would reach for the box to obtain the ball. As action predictions are accompanied by motor activation, we expected to see evidence of motor activation on A+O− trials. However, in the case where the agent has a false belief that the ball is not in the box (A−O+), the observer should not expect her to act towards the box and we should not see evidence of motor activation in the observer. Such differential motor activation would indicate that the observer is indeed interpreting the events as intended and appreciates the consequences of false beliefs for subsequent actions. The second aim of testing adults was to simultaneously obtain eye-tracking data to provide support for our use of motor activation as a measure of action prediction. In previous studies, it has been shown that motor activation accompanies action predictions, and is absent when an action is not expected, in both adults (Kilner et al., 2004) and infants (Southgate & Begus, 2013). Here we hypothesize that participants will exhibit motor activation when they predict that the agent will reach for the box. If observers are indeed expecting the agent to reach for the box, they might be expected to focus more on the agent’s hand when they expect her to reach than when they do not expect her to reach. Thus, we analyzed not only whether observer’s exhibited more motor activation on A+O− trials than A−O+ trials, but also whether they generated more eye-movements towards the agent’s hand on A+O− trials than on A−O+ trials. 2.1 Methods 2.1.1 Participants 11 undergraduate students contributed to the final sample of data. A further 16 participants were tested but excluded from the final sample. Primarily, despite instructing participants to avoid blinking, the long length of trials made this difficult and 14 participants blinked during the anticipation period of most trials and so, as with previous studies investigating motor activation in adults (Babiloni et al., 2009; Streltsova, Berchio, Gallese, & Umilta, 2010), their data was excluded. The data of 2 additional adults was excluded because of excessive noise (1) and technical problems (1). Participants received course credit or monetary compensation for participation. 2.1.2 Stimuli Stimuli consisted of two types of 14s trials. The two types of test trial began with the ball either rolling towards and jumping into the box from the right-hand side of the screen (A+O− trials) or jumping out of the box and rolling away to the right-hand side of the screen (A−O+ trials). After this initial event, a curtain came down to hide the agent. At this point, the box opened again and the ball either jumped out of the box and rolled away (A+O− trials) or rolled towards and jumped into the box (A−O+ trials). In both trial types, the lid then closed and the curtain was raised to reveal the actress stationary and looking downward at the closed box (see Fig. 2 for the same sequence of events in the format presented to infants. The image in Fig. 1 depicts the slightly different arrangement presented to adults). The actress then behaved consistently with her false belief. In A+O− trials, she remained stationary for 1500ms before reaching towards and grasping the lid of the box (1500ms). In A−O+ trials, she remained stationary for 3000ms to equate the length of the two trials. Test trials were presented in a pseudo-randomized order and were presented on a 58×102 cm screen. To keep the adult and infant version comparable, participants were presented with no more than 20 repetitions of each trial type. After artefact rejection, included adults contributed between 8 and 13 (median=10) A+O− trials, and between 6 and 13 (median=9) A−O+ trials. There was no significant difference in the number of trials contributed between the two trial types (p >.4). 2.1.3 Procedure 2.1.3.1 EEG EEG was recorded continuously using a 128-electrode Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor Net (Electrical Geodesic, Eugene, USA), sampled at 250Hz, recorded with respect to the vertex electrode and re-referenced to the average prior to analysis. Following recording, EEG was segmented into 5500ms segments (beginning 3500ms before, and ending 2000ms after, the point at which the agent reappeared) and time–frequency analyses were performed on each artefact-free segment by continuous wavelet transform using Morelet wavelets at 1Hz intervals in the 6–30Hz range. To eliminate distortion created by the wavelet transform, the first and last 500ms of each segment was removed. A 400ms period, beginning 1000ms before the reappearance of the actress, was selected as a baseline. This time window was chosen as the event occurring within it, the onset of the curtain raising to reveal the actress, was the same in both test trial types. Averaged activity in the baseline period was subtracted from the first 500ms following the agent’s reappearance, during which the agent was stationary. Average wavelet coefficients within participants were calculated by taking the mean across trials. Based on previous research indicating the presence of motor activation in the beta band (13–30Hz) in adults (Caetano, Jousmäki, & Hari, 2007; Kilner, Marchant, & Frith, 2009), we analyzed activity across this entire frequency range. Unlike for infants, we had no strong prediction concerning whether motor activation should be lateralized and so we analyzed activity at both left and right sensorimotor electrodes (left: 30, 36, 37, 42; right: 87, 93, 104, 105). 2.1.3.2 Eye tracking Throughout EEG data acquisition, eye-tracking data was also obtained. A Tobii (Stockholm, Sweden) TX300 Eye Tracker was used in standalone mode and with a sampling rate of 300Hz. Eye-tracking data was collected and synchronized with EEG data via custom-built Matlab scripts, employing the T2T package (http://psy.ck.sissa.it/t2t/About_T2T.html). Prior to the beginning of the experiment, a 5-point calibration was carried out. 2.2 Results 2.2.1 EEG Average activity in the 13–30Hz range was compared in a 2×2×2 ANOVA with Time (Baseline vs. agent reappearance), Trial type (A+O− vs. A−O+), and Location (Left vs. Right electrodes) as within-subjects factors. This analysis revealed a significant interaction between Time and Trial type [F(1,10)=13.69, p =.004, η p 2 =.578] and a main effect of Location that approached significance [F(10)=3.56, p =.08, η p 2 =.263]. Consequently, we decided to analyze amplitude at each location separately. A 2 (Time)×2 (Trial type) ANOVA on left hemisphere channels revealed a significant interaction between factors. Follow-up paired-samples t-tests on each Trial Type separately showed that there was a significant decrease in amplitude from baseline to the agent reappearance for A+O− trials [t(10)=2.82, p =.02] but no decrease from baseline to agent reappearance for A−O+ trials [t(10)=−1.25, p =.24]. The same ANOVA on right hemisphere channels did not reveal any significant effects [p’s>.1]. This result implies that adults recruited their motor cortex on A+O− trials, when the agent with the false belief that the object is present should be expected to reach for the box, but not on the A−O+ trials, when the agent with the false belief that the object is absent should not be expected to reach for the box. As with previous research in infants, this effect was restricted to left sensorimotor cortex. The presence of motor activation when the agent had a false belief about the ball’s presence, but not when she had a false belief about the ball’s absence, suggests that participants made a different prediction about what she would do in each case. Specifically, the presence of motor activation, which has previously been demonstrated when adults and infants expect someone else to act (Caetano et al., 2007; Kilner et al., 2004; Southgate & Begus, 2013), in the A+O− condition, suggests that participants expected the agent to reach for the box and based their action prediction on what the agent, rather than the infant, believed to be the case. 2.2.2 Eye tracking To add support to our interpretation that motor activation reflects a prediction that the agent will act in the A+O− condition, but that she will not act in the A−O+ condition, we analyzed participant’s eye-movements during this anticipation period, reasoning that if they were indeed predicting an action in one condition but not the other, that they may also generate overt fixations towards the hand in the A+O− condition but not in the A−O+ condition. Visual inspection suggested that participants fixated 3 regions during the anticipatory period: they remained fixated on the agent’s face, they shifted their gaze to the agent’s hand, or they shifted their gaze to the box in front of the agent. Participants were equally likely to shift their gaze from the agent’s face on both A+O− and the A−O+ trials (median=8 trials for A+O− and 9 trials for A−O+ trials, a difference that is not significant, p =.4). Thus, we asked whether, out of those trials on which participants did shift their gaze during the anticipatory period (valid trials), whether they were more likely to shift their gaze to the hand on A+O− trials than on A−O+ trials. To address this question, we took two measures. First, we asked whether participants were more likely to make a first look to the hand on A+O− trials than on A−O+ trials. To account for the fact that participants did not make an anticipatory look on every trial, 1 This was either because the eye tracker lost the participant’s eyes during the anticipatory period or because the participant did not shift their eyes from the agent’s face. 1 we divided the number of trials on which participants made a first look to the hand by the total number of valid trials (47 % of all presented trials). This analysis showed that participants made significantly more first looks to the hand on A+O− trials than on A−O+ trials [59% of all first looks were to the hand on A+O− trials, compared to only 27% on A−O+ trials, t =(10)=2.74, p =.02], a finding that was also confirmed with non-parametric statistics [Z =−2.1004, p =.04, two-tailed]. For our second measure, we asked whether participants spent longer fixating the hand in the A+O− condition than in the A−O+ condition. To do this, we calculated the total duration of fixations towards the hand on each trial and again divided this number by the number of trials contributing this data. This analysis revealed that participants spent longer fixating the hand in the A+O− condition than in the A−O+ condition [t(10)=2.53, p =.03], a result again confirmed with non-parametric statistics [Z =−2.31, p =.02, two-tailed]. Together, these analyses demonstrate that on trials in which participants should expect the agent to act if they have taken into account her false belief (the A+O− trials), they are more likely to fixate on her hand first, and spend more time fixating on her hand, than on trials in which they should not expect her to act (A−O+ trials). Together with previous research which has implicated the motor system in action prediction (Caetano et al., 2007; Kilner et al., 2004; Schubotz, 2007; Southgate & Begus, 2013; Southgate et al., 2009), the tendency to fixate the agent’s hand during the anticipation period on A+O− trials, when participants also exhibit a significant increase in motor activation, supports our interpretation that the motor activation we see on these trials does reflect the participant’s prediction that the agent will act. 3 Experiment 2 In Experiment 2, we used our EEG measure to ask whether 6-month-olds predict others’ actions in accord with their belief states. Previous research has shown that infants of around the same age are indeed sensitive to others’ beliefs (Kovacs et al., 2010), but it is unknown whether infants of this age have any appreciation of the functional consequences of those beliefs. The experiment was identical to that run with adults with 2 exceptions. First, infants were given 4 familiarization trials to familiarize them with the agent’s goal (to obtain the ball) and the 2 different outcomes (agent reaches, agent does not reach). Furthermore, since we only measured EEG with infants, 2 Piloting indicated that the time spent at the beginning of the study calibrating the eye-tracker reduced the number of trials the infant was likely to tolerate and thus the quality of the EEG data. 2 we reduced the likelihood of infants making large horizontal eye movements during the anticipatory period by positioning the box directly in front of the agent and her hand behind the box (see Fig. 2). 3.1 Methods 3.1.1 Participants 13. full-term 6-month-olds participated in the study (mean age 185days; range 173–204days). To be included in the analysis, infants were required to provide at least 6 artefact- and movement-free trials for each of the two test trial types. An additional 21 infants were excluded from the analysis because they contributed too few artefact- and movement-free trials (17), had extreme amplitude values (z >2.5) (1), or because of experimenter and/or equipment error (3). The final number of infants included and the exclusion rate is typical of EEG studies with infants (Marshall, Young, & Meltzoff, 2010; Saby, Marshall, & Meltzoff, 2012; Southgate, Csibra, Kaufman, & Johnson, 2008; Stapel, Hunnius, van Elk, & Bekkering, 2010). 3.1.2 Stimuli Stimuli consisted of four 7s familiarization trials and the same two types of 14s test trials that were presented to adults. Familiarization trials were included to familiarize infants with the agent’s goal and with both the reach and no reach outcomes, and the outcomes (reach or no reach) were always consistent with the agent’s experience (i.e. she reached when the ball had jumped into the box but she did not reach when the ball had jumped out of the box and left the scene). Both familiarization trials began with an actress seated in front of a small box, the lid of which then opened. In the first familiarization, a blue ball rolled from the right-hand side of the screen and jumped into the box, after which the lid closed and the actress reached towards the box. In the second familiarization, the same ball jumped out of the box, rolled away to the right of the screen, after which the lid closed and the actress remained looking at the box but without reaching. With the exception that, for infants, the box was placed directly in front of the agent, the two types of test trial (Fig. 2) were identical to those presented to adult participants. Test trials were presented in a pseudo-randomized order with the stipulation that within every 10 trials, 5 repetitions of each test trial type should be presented to ensure that we could collect enough data given the limited amount of trials infants were likely to tolerate. 3.1.3 Procedure Four familiarization trials (2 of each kind) were followed by repeated presentations of the two types of test trial until infants became inattentive. The procedure for EEG was the same as described for adults. Unlike for adults, the frequency band that appears to be most reactive during action execution in infants is the alpha band (Southgate & Begus, 2013; Southgate et al., 2009; Southgate et al., 2010). In previous studies with 9-month-old infants, we obtained reaches from infants and identified their individual frequency range (Southgate & Begus, 2013; Southgate et al., 2009; Southgate et al., 2010). However, obtaining clear reaches from 6-month-old infants was often difficult, 3 Reaches at this age were often embedded in ongoing movement and could often not be well isolated from a pre-movement baseline required for identifying the frequency band that is reactive during movement. 3 and so rather than select the alpha frequency band to be analyzed on the basis of participant’s own reaching, we averaged all infant’s data over the 5–7Hz frequency band, which encompasses the alpha frequency band in infants of this age (Berchicci et al., 2011; Marshall, Bar-Haim, & Fox, 2002). Thus, 5–7Hz averaged activity in the baseline period was subtracted from the first 500ms following the actress’ reappearance, during which the actress was stationary. Average wavelet coefficients within infants were calculated by taking the mean across trials. Based on previous work showing that, in infants, motor activation during action prediction is restricted to the left sensorimotor cortex (Southgate & Begus, 2013; Southgate et al., 2009; Southgate et al., 2010), we analyzed activity over the cluster of 4 left sensorimotor channels (electrode numbers 30, 36, 37 and 42). As in infants we expect to find evidence of motor activation within the alpha frequency, we additionally analyzed changes within the alpha band at 4 occipital channels (electrode numbers 70, 71, 76 and 83, approximating O1 and O2 on the 10–10 layout) in order to ensure that any central alpha changes are not confused with occipital alpha changes. Reported analyses reflect data averaged over each cluster of 4 electrodes. 3.2 Results Average amplitude in the 5–7Hz frequency range was compared in a 2×2 ANOVA with Time (Baseline vs. Actress reappearance) and Trial type (A+O− vs. A−O+) as within-subjects factors, and revealed a significant interaction between these two factors [F(1,12)=7.01, p =.02, η p 2 =.37]. Follow-up paired-samples t-tests were carried out on each condition separately. For the A+O− condition, there was a significant decrease in alpha amplitude from baseline to the point of agent reappearance [t(12)=2.31, p =.04], indicating motor cortex activation when the agent, who had a false belief that the ball was in the box, returned to the scene. On the other hand, there was a non-significant increase in alpha amplitude from baseline in the A−O+ condition, where the agent had a false belief that the ball was not in the box [t(12)=1.51, p =.16] (Fig. 3 ). The presence of motor activation when the agent had a false belief about the ball’s presence, but not when she had a false belief about the ball’s absence, suggests that infants made a different prediction about what she would do in each case. Specifically, the presence of motor activation, which has previously been demonstrated when an observer expects someone else to act (Caetano et al., 2007; Kilner et al., 2004; Southgate & Begus, 2013), in the A+O− condition, suggests that infants expected the agent to reach for the box and based their action prediction on what the agent, rather than the infant, believed to be the case. Furthermore, to ensure that our left sensorimotor effect in the A+O− condition reflects changes in the sensorimotor alpha rhythm, and not the more posterior occipital alpha rhythm, we analyzed changes in a cluster of occipital channels where previous studies have shown the visual alpha rhythm to be dominant (Stroganova, Orekhova, & Posikera, 1999). A repeated measures ANOVA with Time and Condition revealed no significant main effects nor interactions [p’s>.5], confirming that our effect is a central, motor, phenomenon. Finally, a non-parametric test confirmed that our results are representative of the group. 10 out of 13 infants exhibited a decrease in alpha amplitude from baseline (indicating motor activation) to agent reappearance on A+O− trials, whereas only 4 out of 13 infants exhibited such a decrease on A−O+ trials. A Fisher’s exact test confirmed that this difference is significant (p =.047, two-tailed). As our paradigm was an EEG paradigm, infants were presented with multiple presentations of the two test videos. Infants contributed a median total of 8 A+O− trials (range=6–12) and 7 A−O+ trials (range=6–12). It is possible that infants therefore learned during the experiment which outcome – reach or no reach – went with which video sequence, and our results reflect a learned association. To address this question, we separately analyzed valid trials that infants contributed from the first half of the experiment (i.e. artefact and movement-free trials occurring during the first 50% of the total trials the infant viewed, median 3 A+O− (range=2–5) trials and 4 A−O+(range=3–5 trials)) and valid trials from the second half of the experiment (median 4 A+O− (range=3–5) trials and 3 A−O+(range=2–5) trials). A repeated measures ANOVA with Time and Condition revealed a significant interaction between Time and Condition for valid trials presented in the first half of the experiment [F(1,12)=7.73, p =.017, η p 2 =.39] and follow-up paired samples t-tests confirmed that there was a significant decrease in alpha amplitude from baseline to agent reappearance over left sensorimotor cortex in the A+O− condition [t(12)=2.60, p =.023], but only a non-significant increase in alpha amplitude from baseline to agent reappearance in the A−O+ condition [t(12)=1.93, p =.08]. However, while the pattern of results in the second half of the experiment was similar, the decrease in sensorimotor alpha from baseline to agent reappearance in the A+O− condition did not reach significance [t(12)=1.52, p =.16] and again there was no decrease in activity in the A−O+ condition (p >.9). The fact that motor activation in response to the reappearance of the actress with a false belief that the ball is in the box (A+O−) is strongest in the first few trials strongly suggests that it is not a result of a learned association formed during the course of the experiment. Furthermore, while it is possible that associations could already be formed after only a couple of exposures, the presence of our familiarization trials provide further evidence against an association-based interpretation of our results. The four familiarization trials provided infants with evidence that, when the ball jumps into the box, the agent subsequently reaches for the box (x2), but when the ball jumps out of the box, the agent does not reach for the box (x2). Thus, if infants were indeed basing their expectations on learned associations, we should expect that their performance on those first few test trials would show the opposite pattern i.e. they would wrongly predict an action following the ball jumping into the box, but not when the ball has jumped out of the box. However, what we actually find on those first few test trials following familiarization is the opposite: an expectation of action following the ball jumping out of the box, and an expectation of no action following the ball jumping into the box. 4 Discussion Recent work has demonstrated that young infants have an early developing propensity to track events from others’ perspectives. In the current study, we go beyond these findings by showing that, not only do young infants track events from others’ perspectives, but also use these representations to generate on-line action predictions. Exploiting the documented correlation between motor activation and action prediction (Caetano et al., 2007; Kilner et al., 2004; Southgate and Begus,2013; Southgate et al., 2009, 2010), we show that 6-month-old infants (and adults) make an action prediction only when it is congruent with an agent’s representation of the world. The ability to generate predictions about others’ actions is crucial to successful social interactions throughout life (Blakemore & Decety, 2001; Verfaillie & Daems, 2002). For humans especially, action prediction likely plays an important role in facilitating cooperation and collaboration (Sebanz & Knoblich, 2009). Studies suggest that, by around 12months of age, human infants are already motivated to help others attain their goals and to engage in collaborative activities with others (Knudsen & Liszkowski, 2011; Warneken & Tomasello, 2006) and an early emerging ability to predict what people will do by considering their goals and beliefs may ensure that infants are ready to take part in, and benefit from, the uniquely collaborative structure of human culture. Indeed, recent research suggests that even at 2months, infants are already anticipating the actions of others directed towards them (Reddy, Markova, & Wallot, 2013), possibly to facilitate the smooth coordination of the action and demonstrating active participation in joint action shortly after birth. While previous studies have used looking-time to expose young infants’ sensitivity to others’ beliefs, it was not clear whether infant’s looking-time responses reflected a prediction concerning how an agent’s representation of events would influence her behavior. There have been a number of recent attempts to deconstruct what it is that infants are doing when they exhibit sensitivity to others’ beliefs and various authors have pointed out ways in which infant’s sensitivity to others’ beliefs could fall short of a true understanding of belief (Apperly & Butterfill, 2011; Rakoczy, 2012). While there are many proposed requirements for a genuine understanding of belief (see Rakoczy, 2012 for a discussion of some of those), one of these requirements is that one can integrate the attributed belief with other mental states (e.g. goals) and understand the functional implications of beliefs for action (Dennett, 1989). To date, we know little about infant’s appreciation of the implications of beliefs for action. For example, in the study by Kovacs et al. (2010), infants longer looking towards an outcome that should be surprising to the agent (but not to the infant) demonstrates that infants have encoded and created a representation of the event from the agent’s perspective, and that this representation interferes with the representation that the infant should have of the event from their own perspective. However, it does not tell us whether infants understand anything about the functional consequences of holding a specific representation. In the current study, however, the fact that infants generate action predictions which are accurate based on consideration of the agent’s representation of an event, suggests that they appreciated something of their functional consequences and thus that infants understanding of others’ mental states goes beyond a mere sensitivity to belief situations (Rakoczy, 2012). However, while the ability to predict others’ object-directed actions may build upon a likely preceding ability to predict actions directed towards the infant (Reddy et al., 2013), it is unclear how infants could come to understand that others’ actions should be predicted based on their beliefs. While several authors have advocated an innate, modular mechanism for attributing mental states (Carruthers, 2013; Leslie, Friedman, & German, 2004), it is also possible that infants could learn that others’ actions are predictable based on certain observable factors. The early propensity to try to predict others’ actions demonstrated by Reddy et al. (2013) may make infants highly sensitive to the factors that modulate others’ actions, such as the physical relationship between the agent and an object (e.g. infants may begin to notice that people’s heads and eyes tend to be directed towards objects that they reach for). While data gathered at 6months cannot decide between innately-specified mechanisms exploiting mental state concepts (e.g. she will search in the box because she thinks/believes the ball to be there) or acquired contingencies (e.g. she will search in the box because she saw the object jump in), it is worth noting that what we demonstrate in this paper and describe as ‘belief-based action prediction’ does not necessarily imply that infants operate with a concept of belief as it is traditionally characterized (Rakoczy, 2012). In functional terms, infants are correctly predicting actions based on the other’s belief state. They expect the agent to reach for the ball because the agent represents the ball as being in the box. In mental state language, they expect the agent to reach for the ball because she thinks or believes the ball to be in the box. However, that infants are accurately predicting the agent’s actions does not necessarily imply that they need be aware that what the other holds is a belief, or have any beliefs about what a belief is (e.g. that it can be true of false). While we have evidence that infants consider the perceptions of the other in generating a prediction about what the other will do, we do not know whether infants maintain this representation as an alternative representation of reality (Kovacs et al., 2010) or whether they realize that the prediction that they generate is based on a representation of the world that may or may not mirror reality (Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005; Scott & Baillargeon, 2009). Accurate predictions can be generated by considering only the others’ perceptual experiences without thinking about whether the resulting representation held by the other is a true reflection of the world (Southgate, 2013). Thus one possibility might be that infants attend to those factors that are most consequential for others’ actions (e.g. the object as it is represented by the other) but do not yet represent these in any relationship with the true state of affairs. In this sense, infants might represent the object as the other represents it, but they may not yet represent this representation as a belief that could be false. While this would be highly effective for predicting others’ actions, it would have limited value as an explanatory mechanism (Southgate, 2013). This distinction between being capable of performing the computations necessary for generating action predictions that are consistent with the others’ belief and being aware that what the other holds is a belief, maps onto the distinction between personal and sub-personal level descriptions made by Dennett. Specifically, while the data suggest that infants represent an event from the others’ perspective (a sub-personal level claim), it is not clear that they understand that what results from the others’ perspective is a particular mental state with particular properties (Rakoczy, 2012). Finally, although we use motor activation as a measure of infants’ ability to make belief-based action predictions, this does not imply that the motor system plays a role in inferring these beliefs (Gallese & Goldman, 1998). Others have made convincing arguments as to why the motor (or mirror) system is not a good candidate for mental state attributions (Jacob & Jeannerod, 2005), but our data also suggest that the motor system is unlikely to be involved in the process of attributing mental states. Mental state attributions are required to generate an accurate prediction in both the A+O− condition and the A−O+ condition. Thus, if motor representations are involved in generating inferences about the mental states that cause behavior (Gallese & Goldman, 1998), they should be recruited in both conditions. The fact that sensorimotor cortex is only recruited when the agent’s false belief should cause her to reach suggests that the involvement of the motor system is one of predicting how the expected action will unfold (Csibra, 2007; Jacob, 2009; Southgate et al., 2010). While previous research has demonstrated that susceptibility to others’ mental states may interfere with infants’ own representations of events (Kovacs et al., 2010), our data suggest that sensitivity to others’ mental states also allows infants to predict what others will do next. This ability to integrate ‘beliefs’ with expected actions goes beyond what has previously been demonstrated, and suggests that young infants understanding of other minds goes beyond a mere sensitivity. Whether or not infants action predictions are mediated by a genuine concept of belief, or whether they are the product of representing the world from the others’ perspective, our data demonstrate that 6-month-old infants are skilled in attending to those factors that are consequential for others’ actions.

Highlights • Fluid intelligence links closely to goal neglect in novel behaviour. • Neglect increases strongly with task complexity. • The task complexity effect is bounded by task-subtask structure. • We argue that complex behaviour is controlled in a series of attentional episodes. • A new account of fluid intelligence is based on episode construction. Abstract Task complexity is critical in cognitive efficiency and fluid intelligence. To examine functional limits in task complexity, we examine the phenomenon of goal neglect, where participants with low fluid intelligence fail to follow task rules that they otherwise understand. Though neglect is known to increase with task complexity, here we show that – in contrast to previous accounts – the critical factor is not the total complexity of all task rules. Instead, when the space of task requirements can be divided into separate sub-parts, neglect is controlled by the complexity of each component part. The data also show that neglect develops and stabilizes over the first few performance trials, i.e. as instructions are first used to generate behaviour. In all complex behaviour, a critical process is combination of task events with retrieved task requirements to create focused attentional episodes dealing with each decision in turn. In large part, we suggest, fluid intelligence may reflect this process of converting complex requirements into effective attentional episodes. Keywords Working memory Goal neglect Chunking Intelligence Cognitive control 1 Introduction Standard tests of “general intelligence” are important for their broad ability to predict success in all kinds of cognitive activities, from simple laboratory tasks to educational and other achievements (Spearman, 1904, 1927). Well-known examples are tests of novel problem-solving or “fluid intelligence”, such as Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Raven, Court, & Raven, 1988) or Cattell’s Culture Fair (Cattell, 1971; Cattell & Cattell, 1973). It has long been recognised that task complexity is a critical aspect of such tests. The best tests of general intelligence – those best able to predict success in many kinds of activity – are complex tasks with many different parts, while simple tasks, often involving many trials of the same, small set of cognitive operations, correlate only weakly with others (Marshalek, Lohman, & Snow, 1983; Stankov, 2000). In this paper we ask why task complexity is so important, and what cognitive operations limit success as task complexity increases (Frye, Zelazo, & Burack, 1998; Halford, Cowan, & Andrews, 2007). Our work builds on the phenomenon of goal neglect described by Duncan and colleagues (Duncan, Emslie, Williams, Johnson, & Freer, 1996; Duncan et al., 2008). Goal neglect is manifest when a participant is able to correctly remember and state a task requirement but fails to fulfil it during performance. This behaviour has been reported in patients with major damage to the frontal lobe (Luria, 1966; Milner, 1963) but also in people in the normal population (Altamirano, Miyake, & Whitmer, 2010; Duncan et al., 1996, 2008; Piek et al., 2004; Towse, Lewis, & Knowles, 2007). In some cases, a whole task may be completed incorrectly, followed by correct recall of the required rules (Duncan et al., 1996), though this may be the extreme case of a more general difficulty in obeying novel rules (e.g. Duncan, Schramm, Thompson, & Dumontheil, 2012). Importantly, goal neglect is closely related to standard measures of fluid intelligence, supporting the proposal that, at least in large part, fluid intelligence concerns the cognitive control functions of the frontal lobe (for related ideas see Duncan, Burgess, & Emslie, 1995; Kane & Engle, 2003; Marshalek et al., 1983; Oberauer, Süß, Wilhelm, & Wittman, 2003). Goal neglect also shows intriguing and unexpected effects of task complexity, suggesting it may be a valuable test bed for cognitive analysis of complexity effects. The phenomenon of goal neglect, and the critical effects of task complexity, can be illustrated by the feature match task used by Duncan et al. (2008) (Fig. 1 ). On each trial, a pair of digits, usually surrounded by a pair of coloured shapes, was shown on a computer screen. Participants were divided into two groups. One group were given instructions for two tasks (full-instructions condition). For digits without surrounding shapes, the task was to add them together and state the result. For digits with surrounding shapes, the task had three rules: if shapes are completely different (different colour and shape), do nothing; if shapes match in a single feature, press a key on the side of the larger digit; if shapes match in both features, again do nothing. Although the participants received instructions and practice for both tasks, the main experimental blocks included only trials with surrounding shapes, and participants were explicitly told that they would not see any digits without surrounding shapes. The other group of participants were never instructed about the trials with no surrounding shapes (reduced-instructions condition), and never received such trials. In both groups, neglect was observed as a tendency to simplify the response set and make consistent errors throughout the task. Commonly, for example, the double-match trials (match in both colour and shape) were treated as though they were single matches. As usual in goal neglect, errors were not explained by the simple forgetting of task rules, as shown by a post-experiment recall test. Instead, often, rules were correctly remembered but still ignored in actual behaviour. Also as usual, neglect was strongly correlated with fluid intelligence. Critically, full-instructions participants were much more likely to show this neglect pattern. Note that the only difference between the two groups was that the full-instructions group had received a more complex set of task rules during instruction; the actual task performed by both groups was exactly the same. Along with similar results in a second task (Duncan et al., 2008), the findings show that neglect is not modulated by task complexity at actual task execution; for instance, by attentional load or the number of behavioural alternatives to be considered during a single trial or even trial block. In this sense it appears very different from standard effects of attentional or dual task load, which usually are tightly time-locked to actual task performance (e.g. Pashler, 1994). Instead, what seems to matter is the complexity of the rules as specified in the initial task instructions. In this paper we pursue the cause of such a complexity effect, and its relevance to fluid intelligence. Task complexity effects have frequently been understood in terms of a limited capacity working memory which has also been linked to general intelligence (Kane & Engle, 2002; Kyllonen & Christal, 1990; Oberauer, Süβ, Wilhelm, & Wittmann, 2008; Süß, Oberauer, Wittmann, Wilhelm, & Schulze, 2002). In general, models of working memory concern combined maintenance and use of task-relevant information (Baddeley, 1986; Cowan, 2001; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Kane & Engle, 2002; Kane & Engle, 2003; Salthouse, 1991). Following up this suggestion, Duncan et al. (2008) proposed an account based on a form of limited working memory capacity. As instructions are presented, they proposed, task knowledge is assembled into a control structure they called the task model. The task model is a limited capacity working memory for the representation of task rules and facts. As more information is entered into the task model and this capacity is filled, multiple task components compete for representation and individual components may be weakly represented and lost, leading to neglect of that requirement during performance. On this account, neglect is driven by the total complexity of task instructions, i.e. the total amount of information to be memorised or entered into the task model as instructions are received. As Duncan et al. (2008) point out, such a task model would need somewhat different characteristics from more standard forms of working memory. Storage capacity would need to be sufficient to hold a whole set of task rules, presented over an extended period of task instruction. The task model, furthermore, would need to be durable, maintaining the full set of task rules even when the participant knew that some rules would be unnecessary for a current block of trials. In these respects, Duncan et al. (2008) suggested that the task model might resemble the concept of ‘long-term working memory’ proposed by Ericsson and Kintsch (1995). Recent data suggest that goal neglect may show stronger correlations with fluid intelligence than several more standard measures of working memory capacity, including visual short-term memory and conventional simple and complex spans (Duncan et al., 2012). In the current work we develop this proposal in light of the broader literature on task complexity. The challenges of complex tasks have been addressed from several perspectives, including artificial intelligence (e.g. Newell, Shaw, & Simon, 1958; Sacerdoti, 1974), functional brain imaging (e.g. Badre & D’Esposito, 2009), the role of complexity in cognitive development (e.g. Frye et al., 1998), and the link to working memory capacity (e.g. Halford et al., 2007). In such accounts, complexity is a matter not simply of the total amount of information in a task description, e.g. the total number of task rules, but also of structural relations between rules, e.g. relations between the components of an argument (e.g. Badre & D’Esposito, 2009; Frye et al., 1998; Halford, Wilson, & Phillips, 1998; Oberauer et al., 2008). In complex tasks, in particular, a critical factor is chunking into separate task parts (e.g. Halford et al., 2007). This requirement for chunking has been recognised in foundational work in artificial intelligence (Sacerdoti, 1974); here we develop it for the link of fluid intelligence to goal neglect. The fundamental need for complex tasks to be divided into parts is straightforward. Complex tasks involve choosing appropriate, goal-directed actions by deploying task-relevant knowledge (Anderson, 1983; Newell, 1990). Correct actions must be chosen by searching through a space of alternatives which grows with problem complexity, making the search increasingly demanding. Without further structure, behaviour becomes chaotic, with too few constraints to shape effective action selection at any one point in the task (Sacerdoti, 1974). The search problem can be simplified by dividing it into a set of separate parts or chunks, delimiting the set of alternatives considered within any particular chunk. Often, this division of a complex problem into separate, more solvable parts is regarded as division of complex goals into simpler sub-goals (e.g. Anderson, 1983; Newell, 1990). In everyday behaviour, this chunking is obvious as a task such as driving to work is separated into independent parts such as finding car keys, leaving the house and locking the door, approaching the car etc. Thus complex tasks are divided into a set of cognitive or attentional episodes, each focusing on just one sub-part. Within each episode, relevant knowledge must be selectively retrieved from memory, and combined with current sensory input to guide appropriate behaviour. This line of thought suggests a potentially critical role of chunking in goal neglect. Once a task model has been established, the knowledge within it must be used to shape correct behaviour, much as actions, productions, etc. are selected in classic cognitive architectures (Anderson, 1983; Newell, 1990). As task complexity increases, it is increasingly critical that each stage of the task is controlled by a focused attentional episode, excluding aspects of the model not relevant to the current decision. Without such focus, task rules are not effectively used, in extreme cases leading to goal neglect. On this account, neglect should depend, not just on total task complexity, but on how easily the information in a task model is divided into separate chunks. Obeying a task rule may be impaired by additional task knowledge that is closely linked to this rule, making clear focus on just the most relevant information hard to attain. Obeying the same rule may be much less influenced by knowledge that is easily separated into a distinct task chunk. The role of chunking and task organisation relates to several themes in the study of fluid intelligence and frontal lobe function. In memory tasks, for example, frontal patients may be impaired in spontaneous organisation of a memory list (e.g. Gershberg & Shimamura, 1995; see also Incisa della Rocchetta, 1986) and helped by explicit grouping of the list into semantic categories (e.g. Kopelman & Stanhope, 1998). In young children, a form of goal neglect is sometimes linked to task switching, for example when cards must be sorted first by one feature and then another. Commonly, the child knows the new rule but continues to sort according to the old one (e.g. Zelazo, Frye, & Rapus, 1996); this form of goal neglect can be ameliorated by encouraging cognitive separation of the two rules, for example by spatial separation of the two stimulus features (Diamond, Carlson, & Beck, 2005). As for fluid intelligence, all tasks, certainly, require a control structure like that proposed in the task model, and variable ability to assemble and use such a structure could explain broad positive correlations across many types of task. Each new problem in a fluid intelligence test, for example, requires assembly of novel information into a complex set of internal operations. Plausibly, fluid intelligence could reflect the ability to manage complex task models, either through capacity to represent larger task chunks (e.g. Halford et al., 2007), or through more effective parsing into focused, functionally separate sub-parts (Duncan, 2010). In the present experiments we extend the task model account to address the role of chunking in goal neglect. As a chunking account predicts, we find that neglect depends on how a total body of task rules is organised into component chunks or sub-tasks. Neglect of a task rule increases with added complexity within one chunk or sub-task; it is independent of complexity in a different sub-task. In a further analysis, we ask when the critical failures of action selection take place, and thus, how the incorrect behaviour of goal neglect develops. One possibility, presumed by Duncan et al. (2008), is that components of a task model are lost as instructions are received. The present account, in contrast, emphasises processes of knowledge use, as the information in instructions shapes subsequent behaviour. Here we show that, when neglect occurs, it is developed and stabilized over the first few performance trials, i.e. as the participant attempts to construct novel behaviour by recalling task instructions. It is during these early performance trials, we suggest, that complexity affects use of a task model to shape behaviour, with poorer search of task-relevant knowledge as its complexity increases, and a strong effect of knowledge chunking. 2 Experiment 1 In Experiment 1, each task consisted of two independent sub-tasks. Only one of the two sub-tasks had to be carried out on any particular trial and each sub-task used largely different stimulus elements. Within each sub-task, one critical aspect – the response decision – was constant. Complexity was manipulated by adding additional rules, determining which element of a display should be chosen before the response decision was made. Though response decision and element selection rules were independent, affecting different aspects of behaviour, we anticipated that added element-selection rules might increase neglect of response-decision rules. For response decisions in each sub-task, we examined the effect of added complexity either within the same sub-task or in the other sub-task. One simple possibility is that the critical factor determining response-decision neglect should be just the total number of rules specified in task instructions. In this case, neglect should increase with additional rules in either sub-task. A more complex pattern is predicted by the chunking account. At the time of response decision, behaviour could ideally be controlled by a focused attentional episode, combining relevant stimulus input with selected response-decision rules retrieved from the task model. Reflecting the usual role of task complexity, however, creating such a focused episode might be harder when additional, element-selection rules are also present in the task model. In particular, we reasoned that rules from different sub-tasks might be more easily separated into distinct episodes than rules from the same sub-task. Accordingly, response-decision neglect should be especially sensitive to added rules within the same sub-task. In our design, the aim was to manipulate the complexity of the task model. A complex sub-task, however, differs from a simple sub-task not just in terms of requiring a more complex task model, but also presents a greater demand during performance. In order to disentangle the effects of task model complexity from those of real-time performance demand, we also included a set of blocks for each task where performance demand was manipulated on a trial by trial basis, independent of task instructions. This was done by including some trials requiring only the response decision, without additional trial complexity. The term goal neglect has been used for errors in various kinds of tasks (De Jong, Berendsen, & Cools, 1999; Kane & Engle, 2003; West, 2001), and it is unclear how closely these are related. Here we link our results to the prior findings of Duncan et al. (1996, 2008) using three criteria. First is gross failure to follow task rules, strongly correlated with fluid intelligence. As in previous studies (Duncan et al., 2008), we score both overall task accuracy, and the frequency of gross performance failure. Second is performance limited by complexity at task instruction rather than complexity on an individual trial. Third is performance error not well explained by explicit rule recall, as tested at the end of each experiment. 2.1 Methods 2.1.1 Participants We recruited 32 right-handed adult participants (12 males, 20 females; age-range: 40–67, M =59.1, SD=5.4) with no history of neurological disorder from the paid volunteer panel of the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. Participants took part after informed consent was obtained. Our sampling from an older population, following Duncan et al. (2008) was motivated by the need to capture a wide range of fluid intelligence scores and ensure adequate sampling in the low range. Once fluid intelligence test performance is matched, goal neglect is independent of age (Duncan et al., 2012). 2.1.2 Apparatus All experiments were conducted on a standard desktop computer running the Windows XP operating system and connected to a Higgstec 5-wire resistive touch screen display. The stimulus delivery program was written in Matlab v6, using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007). Responses were collected via the touch screen. Analyses were conducted using Matlab, Microsoft Excel and SPSS. 2.1.3 Tasks and stimuli Each participant completed 4 tasks, each composed of 2 sub-tasks (Fig. 2 ). There were accordingly 8 different sub-tasks in total, with the same basic structure but involving 8 different kinds of stimulus materials. We begin with an explanation of sub-task structure, and then consider how the combination of sub-tasks created the different experimental conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , using the example of Vehicles, each sub-task came in two forms, simple and complex. In the simple form (Fig. 3A), only the response decision was required. The display consisted of a single panel, presented in one of four possible screen locations, two each to left and right of a central grey dot. This panel contained a picture of a motorbike, beneath it two labelled response boxes, and a number of other surrounding symbols. There were two types of trials, the majority regular and the remainder critical. On regular trials (p =0.75), participants were asked to touch the box containing a lower case letter. On critical trials (p =0.25), a different response was indicated by the symbol (context cue) appearing beneath the chosen response box. The context cue beneath one response box was a triangle, and beneath the other a dot. When the context cue beneath the chosen response box was a dot, the task was to touch not the response box itself, but the dot instead. We designed critical trials to be especially sensitive to goal neglect. First, they were less frequent than regular trials. Second, the two symbols used to signal regular and critical trials were visually similar. Therefore, participants had to closely monitor the symbols to detect changes in context. Accordingly performance on critical trials was our primary measure, with neglect on regular trials anticipated to be less frequent. In the sub-task’s complex form (Fig. 3B), the response decision was supplemented by two additional decisions (panel decisions) determining which stimulus should be used for the response decision. There were now 4 different panels, two to either side of fixation. The correct panel to use was determined by two successive decisions, the first determining side and the second panel within that side. For the first decision the cue was a symbol at screen centre. When this cue was a −, the relevant side was left, while if the cue was +, the relevant side was right. The second decision was based on vehicle identity. On each side of the screen, one panel showed a motorbike and the other a car; the panel to choose was the motorbike (Fig. 3B, extreme left). Once the correct panel was chosen, the response decision proceeded as for the sub-task’s simple form. Since decisions could be scored independently (see below), our interest focused just on response decision accuracy, for sub-tasks in which this response decision was the only requirement (simple form), or in which it was preceded by two additional decisions (complex form). To avoid time limitations, performance was self-paced and participants were given up to 20s to make each response. The inter-trial delay was 500ms. Display structure and layout was similar for remaining sub-tasks (Fig. 2), all with simple forms in which only a response decision was required, and complex forms with additional panel decisions. The complete set of rules for all sub-tasks is listed in Table 1 . For all tasks, displays were 18.75deg in height and 36.02deg in width. Viewing distance was not precisely controlled and all visual angle calculations are based on an approximate viewing distance of 50cm. Fig. 2 shows the pair of sub-tasks contributing to each task. Within each task, trials of the two sub-tasks occurred in random order. The four different experimental conditions were created by varying simple/complex form within each sub-task. For one task (simple–simple condition), both sub-tasks were in the simple form; for one (simple–complex), the first sub-task was simple and the second complex; for one (complex–simple), the first sub-task was complex and the second simple; for one (complex–complex), both sub-tasks were complex. (Note that, in these descriptions, the words “first” and “second” refer to the order of sub-tasks in Fig. 2, and the order in which they were explained in task instructions. As noted above, during actual performance, trials of the two sub-tasks appeared in random order.) The allocation of the 4 tasks or sets of materials (Fig. 2) to conditions was counterbalanced across participants, along with both order of tasks and order of conditions within the session. 2.1.4 Protocol Each participant served in a single experimental session lasting approximately 2h. Session structure is illustrated with an example in Table 2 . The session began with the participant getting general instructions and training on using the touch screen display. This training involved successfully performing single and double taps at different locations on the screen. They were then instructed on a sample task (with a single sub-task in complex form) and asked to respond to 5 sample trials to familiarise them with the structure of the tasks. The materials presented in this sample task were not used in the actual experiment. Each new task began with an instruction period during which the rules of the two sub-tasks were given to the participant one after the other. For each sub-task, rules were explained using an example stimulus display. The experimenter read out the rules verbatim (see Table 1 for text) while pointing to the various stimulus elements on the screen. Participants were told that the tasks were self-timed but that they should respond as quickly as they could while being accurate. After the rules for both sub-tasks were read out, the sample screen was cleared and the participants were asked to repeat all the rules of the task. To aid recall, participants were cued on each rule by being asked a series of questions. To illustrate again using Vehicles (Fig. 3), the questions would be: “How do you decide whether to focus on the left or the right? Which of the two vehicles do you pick? Which of the two letters do you pick? How do you usually respond? What do you do when you see a dot below the lower case letter?” (For simple forms, the first two questions were omitted.) If any error was made during the cued repetition, the experimenter would correct the participant, and the entire repetition sequence would be repeated until the participant recalled all components of both sub-tasks correctly. Participants were then told that they could not be reminded of the rules again. The total number of cued repetitions required before the rules were correctly repeated was between 1 and 3 ( M =1.16, SE=0.04, Mode=1). After the instruction period, participants performed a practice block with 12 trials, which included 5 regular trials and one critical trial for each sub-task intermixed randomly. Following this, participants performed 10 blocks of 16 trials each, each block including 6 regular trials and 2 critical trials for each sub-task intermixed randomly. A final manipulation was added to distinguish effects of task vs. trial complexity. For 5 of the blocks (randomly chosen) within each task (standard blocks), all trials involved the simple or complex form of the relevant sub-task, as specified in the instructions for the current condition. Main data analyses concerned just these standard blocks. For the remaining 5 blocks (mixed form blocks), a manipulation was introduced to separate task from trial complexity. In these blocks, half of the trials from any complex sub-task in the current condition were actually in the simple form, i.e. they contained only a single display panel. Of course, this manipulation had no effect for sub-tasks that, in the current condition, were already in simple form. Participants were fully informed of these manipulations. At the end of all performance blocks, participants were again cued to recall the rules and their responses were recorded. 2.1.5 Culture fair test After the participants had completed all the tasks, the Cattell Culture Fair (Scale 2 Form A) instrument (Cattell, 1971; Cattell & Cattell, 1973) was administered under standard conditions. Participants who had already taken this test within the last 24months were not administered the instrument again, and the previous score was used. 2.1.6 Scoring The intention in this experiment was to compare accuracy of response decisions across task conditions. Accordingly, in the complex case, accuracies for response and panel decisions were scored independently. To calculate accuracy for the first decision (left or right side of display), responses were scored as correct if they involved touching any element on the appropriate side of the screen. To calculate accuracy for the second decision, responses were scored as correct if they involved touching any element associated with an appropriate object type (regardless of which side it was on). Finally, to calculate accuracy for the response decision, responses were scored as correct depending on the response information within the selected panel, regardless of whether the panel was the correct one. Separate scores were obtained for critical and regular trials. Trials were classified as regular or critical based on the context cues associated with the selected panel, regardless of whether this panel was correct or not. For simple sub-tasks, only response decisions were required and scored. 2.2 Results For major analyses, data were taken only from standard blocks, i.e. those for which all trials were in the form (simple or complex) appropriate to the task condition. For the simple–simple condition, all blocks were included as standard and mixed form blocks were identical. In complex sub-tasks, panel decisions were extremely accurate (Decision 1: M =98.2; Decision 2: M =98.1), and not of primary interest. Major analyses concern accuracy of response decisions, especially for critical trials. Results are presented in 3 sections. First we consider how errors in the present tasks relate to previous cases of goal neglect, in particular through strong correlation with Culture Fair score, and many instances of extreme failure to obey task rules even when they were understood and remembered. Second we consider the critical effects of complexity. Third we consider the mixed form blocks, confirming that, in this experiment, errors were controlled by task rather than trial complexity. 2.2.1 Goal neglect Previously, neglect has been shown to be largely restricted to people in the lower part of the fluid intelligence range. In our tasks, for critical trials, the accuracy of response decisions (mean across all sub-tasks) showed a strong correlation with Culture Fair IQ (r =0.57, p <001). The correlation was somewhat weaker for the regular trials (r =0.33, p =0.06). Fig. 4 shows a scatter plot relating response decision accuracies to Culture Fair IQs. Especially for critical trials, these data show a dramatic fall-off in accuracy with IQ scores below 100, with very high error rates in some individual participants. As in previous goal neglect experiments, even though rules were correctly repeated before performance began, they were often poorly followed by low-Culture Fair participants. Neglect is usually manifest in the form of major failures of performance that are persistent throughout the task. In order to discover such cases in our data, for each participant we calculated response decision accuracy for each sub-task separately, so that each participant contributed eight separate scores. Distributions of accuracy in single sub-tasks are shown in Fig. 5 , separately for participants with a Culture Fair IQ below and above 100. The results demonstrate that such major failures of performance did indeed occur in our tasks. In the majority of sub-tasks, performance was in the highest accuracy bin (80–100%). For participants with Culture Fair IQ above 100, performance rarely went below 50%. On the other hand, for participants with a Culture Fair IQ below 100, where neglect is expected, performance fell in the lowest accuracy bin (0–20%) in a significant proportion of sub-tasks. Such neglect cases were seen both on critical and regular trials. We next looked at the pattern of errors participants made in cases of major performance failure. We examined all cases where response decision accuracy was at 50% or below and classified them on the basis of the most common type of error made. On critical trials, we found 30 cases where accuracy was at or below 50%. The most common error pattern (11 of 30 cases) was the frank neglect of the context cue, with participants responding to all trials as if they were regular trials. Another common error pattern (8 of 30 cases) reflected confusion about the response rule to be used on critical trials, with participants using response rules that were relevant in the other sub-task or in previously completed tasks. On regular trials, we found 19 cases where accuracy was at 50% or below. By far the most common error pattern, found in 10 of the 19 cases, involved participants treating regular trials as critical trials. A striking feature of previous goal neglect experiments was the finding that, when probed, participants could often correctly recall a task rule that they had neglected during performance. Therefore, we examined whether response decision errors in our tasks could be explained by the forgetting of task rules. We looked at all cases where performance on regular or critical trials was at 50% or below and asked whether the specific errors made by the participants could be explained by their description of the task rules after the task was completed. We found that only 9 of the 30 cases on critical trials and 8 of the 19 cases on regular trials could be explained by the participant’s failure to remember the rules correctly. To exclude the possibility that complexity effects are driven by rule forgetting, all cases in which post-task recall was incorrect were removed from subsequent accuracy analysis. 2.2.2 Complexity effects The central interest in this experiment was the effect of task complexity. To address this question, response decisions of each sub-task were scored as a function of both this sub-task’s complexity (same sub-task complexity) and the complexity of the other sub-task within the task (other sub-task complexity). Results are shown in Fig. 6 . Values in Fig. 6 are means across first and second sub-tasks; for example, the value for same sub-task simple, other sub-task complex is the mean of data from the first sub-task in the simple–complex condition, and the second sub-task in the complex–simple condition. We used two performance scores, response decision accuracy (percentage correct responses), and mean frequency of major performance failure. For critical trials, the mean response decision accuracy was analysed with a 2 (same sub-task complexity; simple, complex)×2 (other sub-task complexity; simple, complex) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The main effect of same sub-task complexity was significant [F(1,31)=12.72, p <0.01, η p 2 = 0.29 ] confirming poorer accuracy in the complex condition (Fig. 6A). Both the main effect of other sub-task complexity [F(1,31)=0.02, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.01 ] and the interaction [F(1,31)=0.48, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.02 ] were non-significant. The mean frequency of major performance failures on critical trials was similarly analysed. The main effect of same sub-task complexity was significant [F(1,31)=5.94, p <0.05, η p 2 = 0.16 ] confirming poorer accuracy in the complex condition (Fig. 6B). Both the main effect of other sub-task complexity [F(1,31)=0.80, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.03 ] and the interaction [F(1,31)=2.35, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.07 ] were non-significant. Similar results were obtained for regular trials. For mean response decision accuracy, the main effect of same sub-task complexity was significant [F(1,31)=5.20, p <0.05, η p 2 = 0.14 ] while the main effect of other sub-task complexity was non-significant [F(1,31)=0.48, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.02 ]. Their interaction was also non-significant [F(1,31)=0.01, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.01 ]. For the frequency of major performance failures, the main effect of current sub-task complexity was significant [F(1,31)=5.01, p <0.05, η p 2 = 0.14 ] while the main effect of other sub-task complexity [F(1,31)=0.81, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.03 ] and the interaction were non-significant [F(1,31)=0.59, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.02 ]. 2.2.3 Mixed form blocks In this experiment, our aim was to manipulate the complexity of the task model. However, in our tasks, a complex sub-task differs from a simple sub-task not just in terms of requiring a more complex task model, but also presents a greater demand during performance. It is possible, therefore, that the complexity effect we find is driven by the greater performance demand on complex trials. In order to exclude this possibility, we examined performance on mixed form blocks. In these blocks, participants were presented two types of trials. On half the trials, the sub-task appeared in its full (simple or complex) form, as described in task instructions. On the other half of the trials, even sub-tasks that were normally complex appeared in simple form. If our complexity effects are driven by greater performance demand, then response decision accuracies for any complex sub-task should be higher for the simple form trials compared to the full, complex form trials. A paired t-test found no significant difference between mean response accuracies from complex sub-tasks in full, complex form versus simple form, either for critical trials [complex trials: 81.4%±SE 3.0, simple trials: 84.0%±SE 3.1, t(31)=1.61, p >0.1, d =0.28], or for regular trials [complex trials: 87.4%±SE 2.3, simple trials: 89.4%±SE 3.8, t(31)=0.81, p >0.1, d =0.43]. Results were similar for mean frequency of major performance failures for critical trials [complex trials: 0.14±SE 0.04, simple trials: 0.14±SE 0.03, t(31)=0, p >0.1, d =0.00], and regular trials [complex trials: 0.09±SE 0.02, simple trials: 0.09±SE 0.03, t(31)=0, p >0.1, d =0.00]. Matching previous goal neglect findings (Duncan et al., 2008), these data suggest that the complexity effects we found were indeed driven by the complexity of the task model established during task instructions, not by the performance demands of individual trials. 2.2.4 Response times Of course, though not of direct interest, response times were also strongly influenced by same sub-task complexity. On critical trials of standard blocks, participants took, on average, 5902ms to respond in complex sub-tasks and 3908ms to respond in simple sub-tasks. Corresponding values for regular trials were 3053ms and 1966ms respectively. 2.3 Discussion In Experiment 1 we observed the phenomenon of neglect in a set of novel tasks and reproduced a number of the findings of Duncan et al. (2008). In our tasks, performance on response decisions, especially on critical trials, was closely related to participant’s fluid intelligence, with errors much more likely in the lower end of the IQ scale. We also found an effect of task complexity with these errors being significantly more frequent in complex sub-tasks, which had a greater number of task components. This complexity effect was not driven by real-time performance demand during task execution, since performance was similar even on trials involving a simplified version of a sub-task. Errors were also not explained by participants’ forgetting task rules during performance, though in the complex tasks used here, final rule recall was far from perfect. Major performance failures in our tasks took several forms. In some cases there was frank neglect of the context cue, i.e. treatment of critical trials exactly as though they were regular trials. In other cases, errors were made in the decision concerning which trials were regular and which critical, or in choosing the appropriate response on critical trials. In general, however, major performance failures of different kinds all reflected serious failure to use task rules, not usually explained by apparent explicit forgetting. In large part, major performance failures of all kinds were restricted to participants in the lower range of Culture Fair IQ (Fig. 5). Our observation of neglect in tasks where stimulus presentation was unspeeded and response was self-timed is a novel finding. In previous goal neglect experiments, stimulus presentation was always speeded and responses were also sometimes speeded. Our results suggest that time pressure is not a critical factor in the neglect of task rules, and strengthen the conclusion that neglect is not related to real-time demands during task execution. Our principal finding is that, on critical trials, both response decision accuracy as well as frequency of major performance failure were strongly sensitive to the complexity of the same sub-task, but not to the complexity of the other sub-task in the overall task. Similar, though weaker, results were seen for regular trials. These findings show that performance is not controlled simply by the total complexity of task knowledge described in initial instructions (Duncan et al., 2008). At the same time, like previous findings, the results also rule out complexity of the current trial as the critical factor, since for complex sub-tasks in mixed form blocks, performance did not improve when the stimulus on a given trial was simple. This pattern of results is consistent with the chunking account developed earlier. On this account, when task performance begins, it must be shaped by the knowledge provided in task instructions. As in all complex behaviour, a critical process will be constructing a series of chunks or attentional episodes, each focusing on just one part of the whole space of action alternatives and relevant knowledge (Sacerdoti, 1974). The present tasks were designed such that, at least in principle, response and panel decisions were entirely independent. At the response decision phase, knowledge guiding panel decisions was always irrelevant, either within the same or other sub-task. Accordingly, a successfully-focused attentional episode bearing just on response decisions might have been independent of either same or other sub-task complexity. Instead, added panel decisions within the same sub-task substantially impaired response decisions, while added panel decisions in the other sub-task had little or no effect. Especially in participants with low fluid intelligence, the results suggest a limitation in separating the contents of a single sub-task into effective chunks; so that when response decisions were made, access to the correct rules was impaired by the existence within the sub-task of additional, but now irrelevant rules. As mentioned above, later we shall present evidence that critical failures take place over the first few performance trials, as knowledge is first used to shape task performance. In our conception of an attentional episode, relevant knowledge from the stored task model is combined with current sensory input to shape correct behaviour. Given the conditions of the current experiment – with complex rules and unlimited decision time – it is appealing to express failure in terms of failed rule retrieval. In these terms, the conclusion might be that response-decision rules are easier to retrieve when they are not strongly linked to other, currently irrelevant rules – specifically, other rules within the same sub-task. This account has some similarity with accounts of strategic retrieval in working memory and recall tasks, which emphasise the importance of episodic context in delimiting search through stored knowledge (Capaldi & Neath, 1995; Davelaar, Goshen-Gottstein, Ashkenazi, Haarmann, & Usher, 2005; Howard & Kahana, 2002; Polyn, Norman, & Kahana, 2009; Unsworth & Engle, 2007a, 2007b). To explain correct recall of neglected rules at the end of a task, it might be thought that the context cues available to participants during performance are very different from the ones available in a final recall test. In many ways, the latter context may better match the encoding context, providing more effective cues and improving recall of task rules. We would suggest, however, that retrieval of complex task instructions is only one special case of the general problem of dividing complex problems into effective attentional episodes. In prior cases of goal neglect, even simple, easily-retrieved rules may be neglected if they are not strongly cued. In a speeded task, for example, participants may neglect briefly-presented arrows pointing left or right, indicating which part of a screen to monitor for critical events (Duncan et al., 2008). In this case, presumably, the difficulty is not so much retrieving the rule associated with an arrow, but triggering this rule at the right moment in the task. In other cases of forming useful attentional episodes, it is information in stimulus materials themselves that must be organised into useful parts. Perhaps the most obvious example is the problem-solving of standard fluid intelligence tests, requiring search through a large space of possible cognitive operations for useful parts of a solution. For these reasons, we prefer the more general formulation in terms of attentional episodes to a more specific emphasis on complex rule retrieval. A number of factors may determine whether a pair of task requirements is chunked into same or different parts of a task representation or model. One factor, especially relevant in the context of goal neglect, may be the format in which task knowledge was presented to participants. Duncan et al. (2008) have linked goal neglect to events that take place as the participant’s body of task knowledge is established during instruction. In our experiment, instructions to participants were provided separately for each sub-task, one after the other. It is possible that this may have a bearing on the chunking we observed in our tasks. Experiment 2 was designed to test this hypothesis. 3 Experiment 2 In Experiment 2 we asked whether the chunking of task information into sub-task groups was driven by the format in which the instructions were presented. If the task model is assembled as task instructions are being processed, it is plausible that the format of the instructions has a bearing on chunking. In Experiment 1, instructions for the two sub-tasks were presented in chunks, one after the other, providing participants an opportunity to consolidate the first set of instructions before the second set were presented. It is possible that this format of instructions drives chunking of rules into sub-task groups. In order to test this possibility, in Experiment 2 we repeated the complexity manipulations of the previous experiment, but between participants, we manipulated the format in which instructions were presented. One group received instructions in a ‘chunked’ format, grouped by sub-task much as they were in the first experiment. First, all the instructions for one sub-task were read out followed by the instructions for the second sub-task. The other group received instructions in an ‘interleaved’ format. In this case, rules were grouped orthogonally by levels rather than by sub-task. First, rules for panel decisions from both sub-tasks were presented together, followed by the rules for selecting response boxes in both sub-tasks, and finally the response rules for regular and critical trials. If the format of the instructions drives chunking of task requirements, the task requirements from the two sub-tasks should be harder to separate in the interleaved instructions group and we should find an effect of other sub-task complexity. In the chunked instructions group, the instructions are separate and should encourage sub-task chunking as before. On the other hand, if chunking is driven by the inherent structure of task requirements, sub-task chunking should be similar for both the groups and the effect of other sub-task complexity should be weak or absent. 3.1 Methods 3.1.1 Participants Experiment 2 had 48 right-handed adult participants (25 males, 23 females; age-range: 38–69, M =55.5, SD=6.9). 24 were in the chunked instructions group and another 24 were in the interleaved instructions group. Participants had no history of neurological disorder and were recruited from the paid volunteer panel of the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. Participants took part after informed consent was obtained. 3.1.2 Protocol The tasks and stimuli used for Experiment 2 were the same as those from the previous experiment. The only changes from Experiment 1 concerned the way that instructions were presented and the way in which the cued recalls of the rules were conducted. Both of these differed for the chunked and interleaved instruction groups. Each new task began with an instruction period. For both groups, print-outs of sample trials for both sub-tasks (Fig. 7 ) were placed before the participant. The experimenter then read out the rules verbatim while pointing to the various stimulus elements on the print-outs. Participants were told that the tasks were self-timed but that they should respond as quickly as they could while being accurate. To illustrate the different instruction formats, consider the example shown in Fig. 7, using Task 1 (see Fig. 2) in the complex–simple condition. The instructions given to the two groups for this task are shown in Table 3 . In both groups, instructions were organised into three ‘steps’. The first step involved selecting one of the four panels on the screen. When the sub-task was in simple form, there was only one panel and the first step was not required. The second step involved selecting one of the two labelled response boxes in the panel. The third step involved choosing the appropriate response based on whether the trial was regular or critical.In the chunked instruction group, instructions were organised first by sub-task and, within each sub-task, by step. So, participants first received instructions for steps 1–3 for the first sub-task followed by the corresponding instructions for the second sub-task. This was similar to the format of the instructions used in Experiment 1. In the interleaved instructions group, the instructions were organised by steps first and then by sub-task. So, participants received instructions for step 1 for both the sub-tasks, followed by instructions for step 2 for both sub-tasks and finally for step 3. Thus, for the interleaved instruction group, the format of the instructions encouraged chunking by step rather than by sub-task. After all the instructions for the task had been read out, the sample trial print-outs were removed and the participants were asked to recall all the rules of the task. To aid recall, participants were cued on each rule by being asked a series of questions. The cued-recall used the same format as the instructions for each group. To illustrate again using the Vehicles–Books example (Fig. 7), the questions for the chunked instructions group would be: “In step 1, how do you decide whether to focus on the left or the right? Which of the two vehicles do you pick? In step 2, which of the two letters do you pick? Finally, how do you usually respond? What do you do when you see a dot below the lower case letter?” – followed by equivalent questions for books. For the interleaved instructions group, the questions would be: “For the vehicles, in step 1, how do you decide whether to focus on the left or the right? Which of the two vehicles do you pick? For the books, step 1 has already been done for you. In step 2, for the vehicles, which of the two letters do you pick? And, for the books, which of the two lines do you pick? Finally, in step 3, how do you usually respond in the case of the vehicles? And, what do you do when you see a dot below the lower case letter? And, for the books, how do you usually respond? What do you do when you see the letter T below the horizontal line?” If any error was made during cued recall, the experimenter would correct the participant, and the entire cued-recall sequence would be repeated until the participant recalled all components of both sub-tasks correctly. Participants were then told that they could not be reminded of the rules again. The total number of cued recalls required before the rules were correctly repeated was similar in both groups. The chunked instructions group required between 1 and 3 repetitions (M =1.17, SE=0.03, Mode=1), while the interleaved instructions group required between 1 and 4 repetitions (M =1.33, SE=0.05, Mode=1). As in Experiment 1, after the instruction period, participants performed a practice block with 12 trials, which included 5 regular trials and one critical trial for each sub-task intermixed randomly. Following this, participants performed 10 blocks of 16 trials each, each block including 6 regular trials and 2 critical trials for each sub-task intermixed randomly. 5 randomly chosen blocks were standard blocks while the rest were mixed form blocks. After all the blocks were completed, participants were again asked to do a single cued recall of all rules. 3.2 Results Scoring and analysis methods were identical to those used in Experiment 1. Again main analyses concerned accuracy of response decisions in standard blocks. Again, accuracies for panel decisions were very high for the chunked instructions group (Decision 1: M =98.0; Decision 2: M =98.0) as well as the interleaved instructions group (Decision 1: M =97.0; Decision 2: M =98.2). 3.2.1 Goal neglect For the chunked instructions group, the accuracy of response decisions on critical trials (mean across all sub-tasks) showed a strong correlation with Culture Fair IQ (r =0.68, p< 0.001). The correlation was weaker and non-significant for regular trials (r =0.25, p >0.1). Corresponding correlations for the interleaved instructions group were 0.50 (p< 0.05) for critical trials and 0.32 (p> 0.1) for regular trials. Scatterplots for both groups are shown in Figure 8 . To assess neglect, we again focussed on cases of major performance failures where response decision accuracy was at 50% or lower. Data from the two groups were pooled as they were closely similar. In total there were 48 cases of major performance failure on critical trials and 28 cases on regular trials. On critical trials, there were two common error patterns. In 20 cases, participants confused the two context cues. Another 17 cases reflected confusion about the response rule to be used on critical trials, with participants using response rules that were relevant in the other sub-task or in previously completed tasks. Frank neglect of the context cue occurred in only 6 cases. On regular trials, again, the most common error pattern, seen in 20 cases, involved confusing the two context cues. In summary, error patterns were largely similar to those found in Experiment 1 with the exception that frank neglect of the context cue was relatively uncommon. Finally, we examined whether response decision errors in our tasks could be explained by the forgetting of task rules. For all cases where performance on critical or regular trials was at 50% or below, we asked whether the specific errors made by the participants could be explained by their failure to remember the rules correctly. Across the two instruction groups, we found that 23 of the 48 cases on critical trials and 13 of the 28 cases on regular trials could be explained by the rule reported by participants at the end of the task. These cases were excluded from subsequent accuracy analyses. 3.2.2 Complexity effects In this experiment, our main question was whether the format of instructions influenced complexity. Mean response decision accuracies as a function of same and other sub-task complexity are shown in Figs. 9 (critical trials) and 10 (regular trials). On critical trials, mean response accuracies were analysed with a 2 (same sub-task complexity; simple, complex)×2 (other sub-task complexity; simple, complex)×2 (group; chunked instructions, interleaved instructions) mixed model ANCOVA with group as a between subject factor and Culture Fair IQ as a covariate. The main effect of same sub-task complexity was again significant [F(1,45)=19.95, p <0.001, η p 2 = 0.31 ] showing poorer accuracy in the complex condition (Fig. 9A and C). The main effect of other sub-task complexity was non-significant [F(1,45)=0.39, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.01 ], as was the interaction [F(1,45)=0.06, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.01 ]. The main effect of group and all interactions with this factor were non-significant (all ps>0.1). Mean frequencies of major performance failures showed a similar pattern. The main effect of same sub-task complexity was again significant [F(1,45)=10.25, p <0.01, η p 2 = 0.19 ] showing poorer accuracy in the complex condition (Fig. 9B and D). The main effect of other sub-task complexity was non-significant [F(1,45)=2.34, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.05 ], as was the interaction [F(1,45)=1.19, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.03 ]. The main effect of group and all interactions with this factor were non-significant (all ps>0.1). On regular trials, mean response accuracies were similarly analysed. This time the main effect of same sub-task complexity was non-significant [F(1,45)=2.99, p >0.05, η p 2 = 0.06 ] as was the main effect of other sub-task complexity [F(1,45)=0.38, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.01 ] and the interaction [F(1,45)=0.46, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.01 ]. The main effect of group and all interactions with this factor were also non-significant (all ps>0.1). Mean frequency of major performance failures on regular trials were similarly analysed. Again, the main effects of same sub-task complexity [F(1,45)=2.15, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.05 ] and other sub-task complexity [F(1,45)=0.23, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.01 ], as well as the interaction [F(1,45)=0.69, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.02 ] were all non-significant. The main effect of group and all interactions with this factor were also non-significant (all ps>0.1). 3.2.3 Mixed form blocks Finally we examined performance in mixed form blocks. Data from the two groups were pooled. Paired t-tests found no significant difference between mean response decision accuracies from complex sub-tasks in full, complex form versus simple form, either for critical trials [complex trials: 79.7%±SE 3.1, simple trials: 81.5%±SE 3.0, t(47)=1.41, p >0.1, d= 0.20], or for regular trials [complex trials: 87.6%±SE 2.7, simple trials: 89.6%±SE 2.8, t(47)=1.62, p >0.1, d =0.23]. These data suggest that the complexity effects we found were indeed driven by the complexity of the task model established during task instructions, not by the real-time demands of individual trials. 3.2.4 Response times On critical trials, participants in the chunked instructions group took, on average, 3535ms to respond in complex sub-tasks and 2291ms to respond on simple sub-tasks. Corresponding values for the interleaved instructions group were 3602ms for complex sub-tasks and 2159ms for simple sub-tasks. On regular trials, response times for the chunked instructions group were 3389ms for complex sub-tasks and 2060ms for simple sub-tasks, with corresponding values of 3361ms and 2010ms for the interleaved instructions group. 3.3 Discussion In Experiment 2, we replicated our findings from Experiment 1. Response decisions were prone to errors and accuracies strongly correlated with Culture Fair IQ, especially on critical trials. Major performance failures were common, with a variety of error types indicating serious failure to use task rules. Again, such failures were not generally explained by failure of explicit recall. We also confirmed the pattern of complexity effects that we observed in Experiment 1. For critical trials, both the accuracy of response decisions as well as the frequency of major performance failures were strongly sensitive to same sub-task complexity, but largely insensitive to the complexity of the other sub-task. For regular trials, unlike in Experiment 1, neither effect was significant. Again, the data suggest that the key factor in these experiments was not the complexity of all task requirements described during instruction but the complexity of a subset of the requirements which are relevant to a single sub-task. The results from Experiment 2, however, do not support the hypothesis that chunking is driven by the format in which the instructions are presented. Instructions in the two groups were organised quite differently, to encourage orthogonal forms of chunking. The performance of the two groups, however, was closely similar. 4 Pooled data The principal concern in our experiments was the differential effect of same sub-task versus other sub-task complexity. The main finding from Experiment 1, replicated in Experiment 2, was a strongly significant main effect of same sub-task complexity, especially on critical trials, but no effect of other sub-task complexity. An inspection of Figs. 6, 9 and 10, however, suggests a small trend toward lower accuracies for complex other sub-tasks compared to simple other sub-tasks. We therefore re-analysed the complexity effects after pooling the data from the standard blocks of Experiments 1 and 2. Given that we found no effect of group in Experiment 2, we also included the data from the interleaved instructions group. On critical trials, mean response accuracies were analysed using a 2 (same sub-task complexity; simple, complex)×2 (other sub-task complexity; simple, complex) repeated measures ANOVA. The main effect of same sub-task complexity was significant [F(1,79)=46.82 p <0.001, η p 2 = 0.37 ]. Both the main effect of other sub-task complexity [F(1,79)=2.14, p >0.1, η p 2 = 0.03 ] and the interaction [F(1,79)<0.01, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.01 ] were non-significant. The mean frequency of major performance failures was similarly analysed. The main effect of same sub-task complexity was significant [F(1,79)=21.58 p <0.001, η p 2 = 0.22 ]. Both the main effect of other sub-task complexity [F(1,79)=0.02, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.01 ] and the interaction [F(1,79)=0.21, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.01 ] were non-significant. Therefore, even after pooling the data, the pattern of complexity effects for critical trials remained unchanged. On regular trials, data were analysed using a 2 (same sub-task complexity; simple, complex)×2 (other sub-task complexity; simple, complex) repeated measures ANOVA. The main effect of same sub-task complexity was significant [F(1,79)=12.67, p <0.01, η p 2 = 0.14 ]. This time, the main effect of other sub-task complexity was also significant [F(1,79)=4.47, p <0.05, η p 2 = 0.04 ]. Their interaction was non-significant [F(1,79)=0.20, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.01 ]. The mean frequency of major performance failures was similarly analysed. The main effect of same sub-task complexity was significant [F(1,79)=10.01 p <0.01, η p 2 = 0.11 ]. Both the main effect of other sub-task complexity [F(1,79)=1.98, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.02 ] and the interaction [F(1,79)=2.51, p >0.1, η p 2 < 0.03 ] were non-significant. After pooling the data, a small effect of other sub-task complexity was now detectable on regular trials. Importantly, we do not claim that there is no effect of other sub-task complexity, but only that the effect of same sub-task complexity is dominant. A final analysis directly compared the effects of same sub-task complexity and other sub-task complexity. To this end we compared response decision accuracies for two cases: same sub-task simple and other sub-task complex, vs same sub-task complex and other sub-task simple. In these two conditions, complexity of overall task instructions is matched (one simple and one complex sub-task in each case). A comparison of these conditions can be seen as a test of the relative effects of same and other sub-task complexity. For critical trials, mean accuracy in the case of same sub-task simple/other sub-task complex was 92.4%, while mean accuracy for same sub-task complex/other sub-task simple was 82.8%, a significant difference [t (79)=3.67, p <0.001, d =0.41]. For regular trials, mean accuracy in the case of same sub-task simple/other sub-task complex was 95.1%, while mean accuracy for same sub-task complex/other sub-task simple was 91.7%. The difference was not significant [t(47)=1.6, p >0.1, d =0.20]. Similar results were obtained for major performance failures. For critical trials, mean frequency of major performance failures in the case of same sub-task simple/other sub-task complex was 0.03, while that for same sub-task complex/other sub-task simple was 0.12, a significant difference [t(79)=3.00, p <0.01, d =0.34]. For regular trials, mean frequency of major performance failures in the case of same sub-task simple/other sub-task complex was 0.01, while mean accuracy for same sub-task complex/other sub-task simple was 0.04. The difference was not significant [t(47)=1.7, p >0.1, d =0.18]. Our results confirm that, for critical trials, it was the complexity of the same sub-task that most strongly influenced performance, with a similar but non-significant trend for regular trials. 5 Task dynamics Our failure to find an effect of instructional format despite a strong manipulation led us to consider the possibility that the instruction period may be relatively less important in the production of goal neglect. Instead actual task structure, rather than instruction structure, may be critical. On the account we are proposing, neglect reflects a failure to focus on just those aspects of task knowledge relevant to a current decision. This thought led us to consider events on early trials, when task knowledge is first used to control behaviour (Duncan et al., 1996). Additionally, in both our experiments, the effect of same sub-task complexity on neglect persisted even on the simplified trials of mixed form blocks, where panel decisions were not present. This observation also suggests that a pattern of behaviour is constructed early during the task and then tends to remain stable. In order to explore the role of early performance in task assembly and neglect, we examined the trial-wise dynamics of task performance in cases of major performance failure, defined as before as response decision accuracy at 50% or below. Across both experiments, for critical trials there were 78 cases, contributed by 46 of the 88 participants. For regular trials there were 37 cases, contributed by 31 of the 88 participants. In all these cases of major performance failure, participants typically followed a consistent strategy in the performance blocks, with one major error type dominating performance. We asked how participant’s strategy evolved over the early trials. For every such case, we defined two major response strategies – the correct strategy and the dominant incorrect strategy. We then computed the probability on every trial, across all cases of major performance failure, of choosing a response consistent with these strategies. Fig. 11 plots these probabilities separately for critical (Fig. 11A) and regular (Fig. 11B) trials. The horizontal axis shows trial number. Note that the first critical trial and the first 5 regular trials are part of the practice block. Across trials, the figure shows the probability of correct response decision, the probability of making a response that is consistent with the dominant incorrect strategy, and the response time. In these data, the probability of choosing the correct response starts off near 0.4 and then decreases over the first 10 trials to settle close to zero. Conversely, the probability of choosing a response consistent with the dominant incorrect strategy also starts off near 0.4 and increases over the same period to asymptote close to one. Response time rapidly falls during these trials to settle at a stable level after the first 10 trials. This pattern of results shows an important role for early performance in shaping behaviour. The data reveal an initial phase during which performance is inconsistent, with participants being just as likely to choose the correct response as an incorrect response. Performance becomes increasingly stable over the first 10 or so trials as one response rule is privileged over others. Such stabilization may reflect a process of automatisation in which initially encoded rules are compiled into procedures thus reducing cognitive demand (Neves & Anderson, 1981). We suggest that this period represents a learning phase during which task performance is shaped. During this period, as participants make response decisions, they have to search through the space of task knowledge for the relevant rules. When a sub-task contains additional panel rules, the chance of implementing the correct response rule is reduced, resulting in an incorrect choice. With every trial, the choice of behaviour becomes more stable. In cases of major performance failure, an incorrect rule is privileged in the final, stable performance stage. 6 General discussion The results presented here significantly extend the account of goal neglect suggested by Duncan et al. (2008). In that account, the critical factor is the total complexity of task instructions. Duncan et al. (2008) viewed task model assembly as a process of encoding and storing task information into a limited capacity working memory. As more information is entered into the task model and this storage capacity is filled, task rules compete for representation and individual rules may be weakly represented and lost, leading to their neglect during performance. This simple account does not easily explain the pattern of complexity effects that we observe. For our tasks, this account would predict that the neglect of a requirement should be equally sensitive to same or other sub-task complexity, since in either case, added panel decisions have the same effect on total task complexity. Instead, the effect of same sub-task complexity was substantially stronger. Our new account builds on a range of previous work suggesting that task complexity is a matter not simply of the total amount of information in a task description. Also critical are structural relations between rules (e.g. Frye et al., 1998), and in particular, chunking into separate task parts (e.g. Halford et al., 2007; Newell, 1990). Reflecting the critical role of information chunking, our account stresses the creation of focused attentional episodes, dividing complex task requirements into simpler, more manageable parts. Such division allows even complex problems to be solved as a series of simpler sub-problems (Sacerdoti, 1974). In the present experiments, the critical task part was the response decision and its sensitivity to additional panel decisions in the overall task model. Though response and panel decisions were independent, response-decision neglect was increased when panel decisions were added. This effect of added complexity, however, was restricted to panel decisions added within the same sub-task. The results suggest a failure in creation of a focused response-decision episode when response and panel rules were conceptually linked. As a result, we suggest, implementation of the correct response rule was impaired, leading in extreme cases to systematic neglect. Our account shares some ideas with relational complexity theory (Halford et al., 1998, 2007; Waltz et al., 1999) which posits a co-ordinate system or ordering schema for representing relations necessary for carrying out a cognitive process, and proposes a mechanism of ‘segmentation’ for parsing a complex task into separate parts. In our experiments, independent parts of a task that were conceptually linked were harder to separate into separate episodes. This suggests the existence of structural representations that relate the various steps of the decision process. Such a representation could serve as a schema and shape not just behaviour but also the way task knowledge is organised. Indeed, in the interleaved instructions group in Experiment 2, participants often spontaneously and rapidly re-organised instructions by sub-task during verbal report suggesting the employment of such a structural schema. A benefit of such a schema is that new tasks with a similar structure can be learnt more quickly, by binding new task-relevant information to the existing co-ordinate system. On the other hand, such a structural representation may also have a deleterious effect when task structure is variable. In the present experiments, and from the perspective of our chunking account, a representation of the structural relations of the rules may have led to a higher rate of neglect in low IQ participants as they failed to separate panel rules from response rules. Our account is extended by an analysis of the evolution of behaviour during early trials. In this period, action selection initially appears to be unstructured and chaotic, but is rapidly organised into a more automatic stable strategy that is then used for the remainder of the task. We suggest that this initial unstructured period reflects a learning phase and it is in this early phase of task performance that complexity exerts its effects. As the first response decisions are made, significant interference arises from the presence of additional panel rules in the sub-task model. Goal neglect arises when an incorrect plan of behaviour is constructed and stabilized. In our tasks, what drives the chunking? In Experiment 2, we examined the hypothesis that instructional format drives chunking but found no evidence in its support. Despite a strong manipulation of instructional format to discourage chunking by sub-task, we found that the pattern of complexity effects remained unchanged. Another factor driving chunking may be temporal context (Badre, Kayser, & D’Esposito, 2010; Botvinick, 2012; Rigotti, Ben Dayan Rubin, Morrison, Salzman, & Fusi, 2010). During initial performance, the attempt to recall task rules may be driven by the problem stimuli encountered. As participants effortfully access stored task rules while solving initial trials, chunking may be driven by the learning of transition probabilities specific to each sub-task. For instance, after the ± rule for vehicles is accessed, the car/motorbike rule will always be required followed by the lower/upper case letter rule and so on. The open/closed book rule will never be needed after the ± rule. Learning these temporal regularities may allow for construction of separate higher level context representations for each sub-task. At the same time, such temporal linkages would be a barrier for the further division of a sub-task into component episodes (Botvinick, Niv, & Barto, 2009). Chunking may also have been driven by the fact that the two sub-tasks in our tasks had independent sets of rules, with largely independent stimulus sets. The stimuli themselves could directly activate the appropriate task knowledge in a bottom-up manner. At the same time, the task rules within a sub-task are all functionally linked to each other, describing the various steps in a decision process and thus demanding the top-down influence of a task model for driving the search within the selected set of action alternatives. As in previous cases of goal neglect, we found that the accuracy of response decisions was strongly correlated with Culture Fair IQ. The results suggest a general approach to the problem of task complexity and its link to fluid intelligence. In any domain, increasing task complexity increases the search space of potential action alternatives, and the requirement for simplifying search through division into separate, simpler sub-tasks. In large part, we suggest, fluid intelligence may concern this search problem, with high fluid intelligence reflecting either the capacity to deal with larger information chunks, or capacity for division of large chunks into smaller, more focused parts. As argued earlier, a close link to goal neglect suggests a central role of frontal lobe control processes in fluid intelligence (Duncan et al., 1996). On many accounts, the frontal lobe is critical in attentional control, integrating processing in multiple brain systems to construct coherent, focused behavioural episodes (Dehaene, Kerszberg, & Changeux, 1998; Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Norman & Shallice, 1980). In summary, our results demonstrate an important role for chunking in shaping competition between task requirements in the task model. We propose a new account of neglect that emphasises the importance of chunking in navigating the space of task knowledge in goal-directed behaviour, in particular during a labile phase over the first few trials of performance. More broadly, our results suggest a general approach to the well-known link between task complexity and fluid intelligence (Marshalek et al., 1983). At least in large part, fluid intelligence may concern the problem of selecting effective behaviour based on complex knowledge; a problem that must generally be solved by dividing a complex problem space into smaller, more manageable parts.

Abstract The close relationship between temporal perception and speech processing is well established. The present study focused on the specific question whether the speech environment could influence temporal order perception in subjects whose language backgrounds are distinctively different, i.e., Chinese (tonal language) vs. Polish (non-tonal language). Temporal order thresholds were measured for both monaurally presented clicks and binaurally presented tone pairs. Whereas the click experiment showed similar order thresholds for the two language groups, the experiment with tone pairs resulted in different observations: while Chinese demonstrated better performance in discriminating the temporal order of two “close frequency” tone pairs (600Hz and 1200Hz), Polish subjects showed a reversed pattern, i.e., better performance for “distant frequency” tone pairs (400Hz and 3000Hz). These results indicate on the one hand a common temporal mechanism for perceiving the order of two monaurally presented stimuli, and on the other hand neuronal plasticity for perceiving the order of frequency-related auditory stimuli. We conclude that the auditory brain is modified with respect to temporal processing by long-term exposure to a tonal or a non-tonal language. As a consequence of such an exposure different cognitive modes of operation (analytic vs. holistic) are selected: the analytic mode is adopted for “distant frequency” tone pairs in Chinese and for “close frequency” tone pairs in Polish subjects, whereas the holistic mode is selected for “ close frequency ” tone pairs in Chinese and for “ distant frequency ” tone pairs in Polish subjects, reflecting a double dissociation of function. Keywords Time perception Auditory processing Temporal order threshold Language experience Double dissociation of function 1 Introduction Temporal information processing plays an important role in cognitive processes like perception, attention, working memory, movement control or language (for an overview, see Fingelkurts & Fingelkurts, 2006). One domain of temporal processing is related to sequential timing in the range of some tens of milliseconds (Fink, Churan, & Wittmann, 2006; Pöppel, 2009; Szymaszek, Sereda, Pöppel, & Szelag, 2009). In order to discriminate accurately the temporal order of two successively presented stimuli, independent of stimulus modality (auditory, visual, or tactile) a time interval of approximately the same duration is required between the onsets of the two stimuli (Hirsh & Sherrick, 1961). This minimum time interval is termed as temporal order threshold (TOT), which indicates a necessary temporal interval for establishing the before–after relationship of successive stimuli. A lower TOT indicates better temporal order processing. Previous studies have revealed a number of factors that can influence TOT such as age, gender, stimulus type or presentation mode. Young children usually have difficulties to perform the temporal order task and their TOTs tend to decrease as they grow older (Berwanger, Wittmann, von Steinbüchel, & von Suchodoletz, 2004). Compared to young adults, elderly people usually demonstrate higher TOTs (Kolodziejczyk & Szelag, 2008; Szymaszek, Szelag, & Sliwowska, 2006; Ulbrich, Churan, Fink, & Wittmann, 2009). Men tend to have lower TOT than women for discriminating two identical clicks, each being presented to one ear (Lotze, Wittmann, von Steinbuchel, Pöppel, & Roenneberg, 1999; Wittmann & Szelag, 2003). Compared to monaurally presented clicks, binaurally presented tones usually result in lower TOT as observed in various subjects groups (Fink, Ulbrich, Churan, & Wittmann, 2006). Although several factors influencing TOT have been addressed, no sufficient evidence is available regarding whether speech experience itself can influence TOT. This question is important since a close link between temporal information processing and language capabilities has been suggested in previous research. Children with language learning impairment and patients with acquired aphasia or dyslexia often demonstrate both language disabilities (e.g., deficits in phoneme identification and/or discrimination) and deteriorated timing (e.g., increased TOT for detecting the temporal order of sequentially presented acoustic stimuli) (Ben-Artzi, Fostick, & Babkoff, 2005; Gaab, Gabrieli, Deutsch, Tallal, & Temple, 2007; Sidiropoulos, Ackermann, Wannke, & Hertrich, 2010; Szelag, von Steinbüchel, & Pöppel, 1997; Tallal, Merzenich, Miller, & Jenkins, 1998; Tallal et al., 1996; Vandermosten et al., 2011; Wittmann & Fink, 2004). Based on these observations temporal order processing as an underlying basis for language comprehension is assumed. However, a reversed consideration might also be interesting, i.e., whether language experience may influence temporal order processing. Apparently, only one study thus far addressed this question (Szelag et al., 2011). The results seem to suggest a common and language-independent mechanism for temporal order processing, since no language effect on TOT was observed. However, not having observed such an effect on TOT might have had several reasons. First, the subjects tested in their study were German and Polish, whose native languages are different in many aspects, but also share important similarities, since both German and Polish fall into the same category of non-tonal languages. Thus, these two languages might be not sufficiently different for capturing a potential language effect on temporal order processing. Second, the acoustic stimuli used for measuring TOT in their study were two identical brief stimuli (1ms clicks) which are qualitatively different from two stimuli such as tones with different frequencies. Successive presentation of two tones with different frequencies mimics better the frequency variations that one experiences in a natural speech environment. Third, the two clicks in their temporal order measurements were presented monaurally with one click to one ear (e.g., left ear) and the other click to the other ear (e.g., right ear). This stimulus presentation mode is obviously different from a normal auditory environment, in which speech signals are simultaneously received from both ears. In order to answer the question whether language experience influences temporal order processing the temporal characteristics of tonal and non-tonal languages have to be addressed in more detail. It is well known that temporal cues in speech signals play an important role in decoding syllables or words into their phonemic segments for auditory comprehension. For example, to discriminate “duck” and “tuck” in English, or “dui” and “tui” in Chinese, the voice-onset-time (VOT, the time distance between the burst and the onset of laryngeal pulsing) for voiced and unvoiced consonants (/d/ and /t/) plays a crucial role, since the VOT in many languages has different duration. Besides this general aspect, tonal and non-tonal languages differentiate themselves in some temporal characteristics such as the number of syllables in a word, the duration of consonants or vowels. A tonal language such as Chinese is mainly monosyllabic, while non-tonal languages such as English, German and Polish are typically multisyllabic. The duration of vowels in Chinese generally lasts longer than that in non-tonal languages. However, the most salient difference in temporal characteristics between tonal and non-tonal languages is related to pitch contour (Kann, Wayland, Bao, & Barkley, 2007; Krishnan, Gandour, & Bidelman, 2010; Luo, Boemio, Gordon, & Poeppel, 2007). Unlike non-tonal languages such as German and Polish, the meaning of a word in a tonal language such as Chinese cannot be solely defined by consonants and vowels without a lexical tone. For example, the Chinese syllable /ba/ may has four distinct lexical meanings when spoken with different pitch contours. It can mean the digit “8” when pronounced with a high level tone, the action “pulling up” with a high rising tone, the “target” for hunting with a low dipping tone, or the appellation “father” with a high falling tone. Therefore, to extract the meaning of Chinese words, the pitch contour which features small changes in frequency range plays a crucial role. In contrast, non-tonal languages such as English, Germany and Polish only have one single lexical meaning in one syllable regardless of some possible tone variations; thus, it is the pitch height, not the pitch contour, which is important in decoding semantic information. In other words, non-tonal languages are characterized by the large changes in frequency range, and the pitch contour plays barely any role in decoding lexical meanings. Considering the limitations in the study mentioned above (Szelag et al., 2011) and the major difference between tonal and non-tonal languages as outlined above, the question of whether a language environment may influence temporal order processing has to be addressed again. Therefore, we designed two experiments in the present study. Experiment 1 aimed to replicate the study by Szelag et al. (2011) using monaurally presented clicks in two other language groups, i.e. Chinese and Polish subjects. The purpose of this experiment was to test whether the previous finding could also be observed in subjects whose language environments were distinctively different. If a common temporal mechanism exists, then no TOT difference should be observed between the two language groups. If there is, however, a language impact on temporal order processing, and if this effect can even be captured by monaurally presented click measurements, then significantly different TOTs should be observed for the two language groups. In Experiment 2 we used binaurally presented two tones of different frequencies as stimuli to measure the TOTs. In order to capture the most salient difference between tonal and non-tonal languages, we manipulated the frequency distance between the two tones and tested two types of tone pairs. One is “close frequency” tone pairs using 600Hz and 1200Hz tones as stimuli; the other is “distant frequency” tone pairs using 400Hz and 3000Hz tones. Since tonal language subjects such as Chinese are experienced in detecting pitch contours in their natural language environment, we assume that for Chinese subjects a lower TOT for the “close frequency” relative to the “distant frequency” tones might be observed, since for Chinese subjects the temporal order task using two “close frequency” tones might be treated as a task of detecting pitch contours with either an up or a down patterning of frequency steps. Since Polish subjects rarely experience detecting pitch contours in their natural speech environment, equally high TOTs are anticipated for discriminating the temporal order of both the “close frequency” and the “ distant frequency” tones. 2 Methods 2.1 Participants Two groups of volunteers with different language background (NP group: 18 native Polish speakers; NC group: 18 native Chinese Mandarin speakers) participated in the present study. Each language group was half male and half female, aged on average 25years. The NP participants were recruited in the area of Warsaw and had no previous experience of Chinese. The NC participants were recruited in the area of Beijing and had no previous experience of Polish. All participants were right-handed (Oldfield, 1971) and had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, or any indication of cognitive impairment. All participants had received a college education with years varied slightly due to the different education systems in each country. None of the participants had received professional musical education in special schools or universities, which possibly could increase the sensitivity of auditory perception of acoustic stimuli. To ensure normal hearing in all participants, pure-tone audiometry screening was performed (Audiometer AS 208 or GSI 17). The adaptive procedure used frequencies ranging from 250Hz to 3000Hz (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000Hz) and a dB range from −10dB to 100dB in steps of 5dB. The criteria for admission to the present study were a hearing level below 30dB for all frequencies tested and differences in hearing level between the two ears below 20dB (ANSI, 2004). To assess the intellectual abilities of the two language groups, non-verbal Mosaic Test from the widely used HAWIE-R test battery (see Tewes, 1994) was performed. This test is the subtest of the HAWIE-R correlating highest with the total score of the non-verbal activity part of the HAWIE-R, thus being an indicator of general fluid intelligence. During the Mosaic Test subjects were asked to copy a pattern of red and white squares presented on a picture using four or nine red and white cubes. A total number of nine different patterns were presented. The first five patterns were easier requiring only four cubes. The last four patterns were more difficult and had to be copied with nine cubes. Subjects would receive scores when they replicated the patterns correctly within a given time frame of 60s (four cubes) or 120s (nine cubes). The faster they solved each pattern, the higher the score they would receive. For both the NP and the NC participants, matched Mosaic scores were obtained. Detailed descriptive data of the participants are listed in Table 1 . Separate studies in Warsaw and in Beijing for the two language groups were conducted using identical experimental procedures. Each participant was tested individually in two separate sessions in two different days in a soundproof room. Informed consent was provided before and rewards were provided afterward. 2.2 Materials and procedure All stimuli used for temporal order measurements were pairs of acoustic stimuli, which were generated with the program Cool Edit 2000 (sampling rate 44,100Hz, 16-bit). The two paired stimuli were presented in a rapid succession with varied inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) which were controlled by a YAAP (Treutwein, 1997) algorithm. Details are described below. 2.2.1 Experiment 1 Experiment 1 used pairs of clicks as stimuli. The clicks were 1ms rectangular pulses presented in an alternating monaural stimulation mode, i.e., one click was presented to one ear, followed by another click to the other ear. Subjects were asked to indicate the sequence of the two clicks by pointing to one of the two response cards: “left–right” or “right–left”. 2.2.2 Experiment 2 Experiment 2 used two types of paired sinusoidal tones as stimuli. One was “close frequency” tones consisting of a low tone of 600Hz and a high tone of 1200Hz. The other was “distant frequency” tones consisting of a low tone of 400Hz and a high tone of 3000Hz. The duration of each tone was 10ms with 1ms rise-and-fall time. The two tones in each trial were presented in a binaural stimulation mode, i.e., each tone was presented to both ears with a short gap in between. The subjects had to indicate the temporal order of the two tones by pointing to one of the two response cards: “low–high” or “high-low”. 2.2.3 YAAP procedure In both experiments, the inter-stimulus intervals between the two acoustic stimuli were controlled by a maximum-likelihood based algorithm – YAAP (Treutwein, 1997) procedure. According to the subjects’ previous responses, the ISI of the present trial was set at the current best estimate of the threshold corresponding to 75% correct responses based on a logistic psychometric function. The YAAP test included two phases. In an initial phase, ten pairs of stimuli were presented. The first inter-stimulus interval started at 80% of a pre-defined upper limit (200ms in both Exp1 and Exp2) and proceeded in equal steps of 20% to a specified lower limit (10ms in Exp1 and 1ms in Exp2, yielding a same minimum SOA of 11ms). In the second phase, presented inter-stimulus intervals were based on the estimation process of the YAAP algorithm. The stimulus presentation was terminated when the location of the threshold parameter was with a probability of 95% inside a ±5ms interval around the currently estimated threshold (Treutwein, 1995). For all measurements, each trial started with three warning signals prior to the presentation of the paired stimuli to focus the subjects’ attention on the coming task. The time between the warning signal and the first stimulus was 1500ms. All stimuli were presented via a headphone (SONY MDR-CD 480) at a comfortable listening level which is well above threshold. The frequency discrimination thresholds for the four tones used (400Hz, 600Hz, 1200Hz, and 3000Hz) were not measured, since the frequency distance in all tone pairs were far beyond the bandwidth or difference limens of the four frequencies selected (Zwicker, Flottorp, & Stevens, 1957). The main measurement in each experiment was preceded by a practice session in which participants reported the temporal order of the two acoustic stimuli presented with a constant, relatively long ISI of 160ms. The practice was continued until a criterion of 11 correct responses in a series of consecutive 12 presentations was reached. 3 Results 3.1 Temporal order threshold (TOT) The sequencing ability was indexed by the temporal order threshold (TOT) which was defined as the minimum time interval required for correctly identifying the temporal order of two successively presented stimuli. According to previous studies, either the inter-stimulus interval (ISI), i.e., the time interval between the offset of the first stimulus and the onset of the second stimulus, or the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), i.e., the time interval between the onset of the first stimulus and the onset of the second stimulus, can be used as index of TOT. Since the presentation time of clicks (1ms) in Experiment 1 and the presentation time of tones (10ms) in Experiment 2 were different, we chose to use SOA (i.e., ISI+duration of the first stimulus) to measure the TOT in both experiments so as to have a unified index for comparison. To obtain individual values of TOT, a logistic psychometric function was fitted to the subject’s data, using MATLAB toolbox psignifit version 2.5.41 (see http://bootstrapsoftware.org/psignifit/), a software package which implements the maximum-likelihood method described by Wichmann and Hill (2001). This procedure estimates an ISI corresponding to 75% correct order discrimination (Strasburger, 2001). We further calculated SOA by adding the stimulus duration (clicks: 1ms; tones: 10ms) to the ISI to obtain the TOT values for later statistical analysis. For example, an ISI of 20ms represents a SOA of 21ms for click measurements and 30ms for tone measurements. In both experiments, an averaged TOT value of two separate sessions for each subject was calculated and used as dependent variable for later statistical analysis in the present study. 3.2 Experiment 1 For click experiment a two-way ANOVA was performed with subject Group (Chinese vs. Polish) and Gender (male vs. female) as two independent variables. The results demonstrated a significant main effect of Gender, F (1,32) =4.224, P <0.05, η p 2 = 0.117 . Males showed a lower TOT than females, confirming a better temporal processing of monaurally presented clicks in males (Lotze et al., 1999; Wittmann & Szelag, 2003). The main effect of subject Group was not significant, F (1,32) =0.919, P =0.345, η p 2 = 0.028 . The two-way interaction was not significant either, F (1,32) =0.127, P =0.724, η p 2 = 0.004 . See Fig. 1 for the visualized main effects of Gender and subject Group. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that temporal order processing as measured with monaurally presented clicks is independent of subjects’ tonal and non-tonal language backgrounds, which is consistent with previous observation (Szelag et al., 2011). 3.3 Experiment 2 For tone experiment a three-way mixed ANOVA was performed with subject Group (Chinese vs. Polish) and Gender (male vs. female) as two between-subjects variables and the stimulus Type (close frequency vs. distant frequency tone pairs) as one within-subjects variable. All main effects and interactions were non-significant except the two-way interaction between stimulus Type and subject Group, F (1,32) =26.593, P <0.001, η p 2 = 0.454 . This highly significant two-way interaction is illustrated in Fig. 2 , and it has to be emphasized that this interaction was the same for both male and female subjects since no gender effect and no interaction between gender and other variables were observed. Further analysis of this interaction revealed very interesting TOT patterns between the two language groups: For the NC group, a significantly lower TOT was observed for discriminating the temporal order of two close frequency tones (600Hz and 1200Hz) relative to the two distant frequency tones (400Hz and 3000Hz) (27ms vs. 51ms, P <0.01). However, for the NP group, a reversed pattern was observed, i.e., a significantly higher TOT was demonstrated for the close frequency tone pairs as compared to the distant frequency tone pairs (64ms vs. 30ms, P <0.001). This double dissociation result pattern indicates an important language impact on temporal order processing of binaurally presented tone stimuli. 4 Discussion The present study measured temporal order thresholds with both monaurally presented clicks (Exp1) and binaurally presented tones (Exp2) in both tonal (Chinese) and non-tonal (Polish) language speakers. The results of Exp1 confirmed the previous observation by Szelag et al. (2011). Like in the comparison of Polish and German subjects no TOT difference between Chinese and Polish subjects was observed. Thus, the click TOT might indeed tap a general phenomenon in temporal processing, i.e., a common neural mechanism underlying milliseconds timing which governs click ordering. This mechanism may set a fundamental basis of temporal processing for both tonal and non-tonal language speakers. In fact, the observed gender effect (i.e., males performed better than females in click TOT measurement, which was consistent with previous findings) which did not interact with any other factors further indicated that this common temporal mechanism exists similarly for males and females in both tonal and non-tonal language environments. However, as predicted in the introduction, a language impact on tone order thresholds was captured in Exp2. For Chinese subjects who were experienced with detection of pitch contours, a significantly lower TOT was observed for “close frequency” tones relative to “distant frequency” tones. This difference was not shown for Polish subjects whose language is not characterized by pitch contours. It came as a surprise, however, that the Polish subjects showed also a TOT difference, i.e., a lower order threshold for the “distant frequency” tones as compared to the “close frequency” tones. Thus, a double dissociation was observed which was not predicted. Moreover, different from click experiment (Exp1), no gender effect was observed in the tone experiment (Exp2). The fact that in one case it was observed and in the other it was not further supports the idea that different temporal mechanisms are involved in click and tone order processing. As already known, subjects might use different processing modes or “strategies” to decode the sequence of the two acoustic events. One such strategy can be referred to as “analytic”: Subjects have to identify the singular acoustic events in their identity and on that basis they have a direct experience of the temporal order of these events. For example, in the click experiment the two clicks were presented monaurally, i.e., each being presented to one ear. Thus, the click experiment consists not only of a temporal order task, but also a spatial localization task. Therefore, the subjects may localize the source of the first click (left or right) and then the source of the second click (right or left) immediately after the stimulus presentation, and the temporal order judgment is directly based on such spatial information of the stimuli. Similarly, in the tone experiment although the two acoustic stimuli were presented binaurally (thus no spatial information was available), they were different in frequencies; one is a high tone, and the other is a low tone. Thus, the tone experiment involves not only a temporal order task, but also a frequency discrimination task. Therefore, the subjects may identify the frequency of each tone immediately following the presentation of the stimulus, and on that basis report the temporal order of the two tones. Another strategy to build up a temporal relationship of two acoustic stimuli can be referred to as “holistic”: The two successively presented acoustic events are integrated into one unitary percept with either a rising or a falling frequency modulated sweep. On the basis of recognizing this pitch contour like global patterning (frequency goes up or goes down), subjects reconstruct secondarily the temporal order of the two stimuli (reporting “high–low” or “low–high”), leaving the identification of each individual tone unnecessary (Brechmann & Scheich, 2005; Szymaszek et al., 2009). Such a holistic processing must be based on acoustic information starting from the onset of the first stimulus until the end of the second stimulus in order for subjects to perceive a global frequency variation pattern. Compared to the analytic processing, the holistic processing usually leads to a lower temporal order threshold. The results of the present study can be interpreted by the two different operative modes of temporal order processing. In the click experiment where each click was presented for 1ms with a varied interval, it was impossible to integrate the two clicks into one unitary percept when they are separated by a gap exceeding 3–5ms (Fink, Churan, et al., 2006). Therefore, an analytic mode was adopted for reporting the temporal order of two clicks. In the tone experiment, when the time interval between the two successive tones was relatively long, a similar analytic processing mode was presumably adopted for reporting the temporal order of the two tones. When the time interval decreased, a holistic processing mode might operate in a way that subjects integrated the two tones into one percept with either an up (from low frequency to high frequency) or a down (from high frequency to low frequency) spectral glide, and the temporal order of the two tones was reconstructed secondarily from the direction of the frequency modulated sweeps. Interestingly as revealed by the tone experiment, such a holistic operating mode was apparently modified by long-term exposure to a native language environment. As predicted, the Chinese subjects seemed to use a holistic processing for the two “close frequency” tones, leading to a significantly lower TOT than for the two “distant frequency” tones. However, the Polish subjects, who were not experienced with “pitch contour” detection in their natural language environment, also showed surprisingly a lower TOT but for the “distant frequency” tones. Thus, one has to argue that Polish subjects also use holistic processing for detecting the temporal order of the two “distant frequency” tones. This implies that Polish subjects have a higher sensitivity to large frequency variations possibly due to the phonetic characteristics of their non-tonal language. For Polish subjects, the “close frequency” tones do not elicit a global processing presumably due to the fact that their non-tonal language environment has not produced a specific sensitivity for small variations of frequency change as compared to Chinese subjects. Thus, they adopt an analytic strategy for perceiving the temporal order of the two “close frequency” tones. Our interpretation of the holistic processing mode being shaped by tonal or non-tonal language environment seems to be consistent with previous single neuron recordings, which suggest that neurons in the primary auditory cortex are selective to directions of frequency modulated sweeps (e.g., Tian & Rauschecker, 2004). Possibly, such neurons are differentially stimulated during the long-term exposure to a tonal or a non-tonal language environment, leading to different sensitivities of such neurons. Thus, a flexible holistic processing tuned by native language environment, perhaps, indicates a neural plasticity as suggested in a previous study (Merzenich & Sameshima, 1993). The results of our tone experiment (Exp2) support the hypothesis that language environment has an influence on temporal processing. Thus, one has to conclude that not only temporal processing affects speech processing as referred to in the introduction, but that the reverse is also true. This leads to a logical challenge, i.e., temporal processing underlying speech processing is itself altered by speech processing. This is obviously a circular argument. How does the brain get out of this bi-directional interaction? One may argue that such an impact of language on sequential timing works only within temporal limits. There is evidence for a “temporal window” of some tens of milliseconds as observed with a number of different experimental paradigms which suggest the general principle of discrete time sampling in neuronal information processing, and on that basis indicating physiological temporal limits which for integration of neuronal information presumably cannot be transcended. Such an interval of temporal integration has to be assumed on the basis of a theoretical account: information to be processed is not available at pre-defined time points because of different transduction time in various sensory modalities (e.g., being much shorter in the auditory compared to the visual modality); furthermore, the physical distance of stimuli is relevant in the auditory but not in the visual modality under ecological conditions resulting in a particular challenge for intersensory integration. Thus, temporal windows have been proposed as system states for integration of neuronal information (Pöppel, 1997, 2009; Pöppel, Schill, & von Steinbüchel, 1990). Empirical support for this concept of discrete time sampling in the temporal range of some tens of milliseconds comes for instance from the multimodal response distributions as measured by choice reaction time (Pöppel, 1970), pursuit eye movement latencies (Pöppel & Logothetis, 1986), and anticipatory movements during sensorimotor synchronization (Radil, Mates, Ilmberger, & Pöppel, 1990). Similarly, oscillations of neuronal populations with periods in the domain of some tens of milliseconds (Galambos, Makeig, & Talmachoff, 1981; Madler & Pöppel, 1987) as well as single cell activities as observed in the accessory visual pathway (Podvigin, Jokeit, Pöppel, Chizh, & Kiselyeva, 1992; Podvigin et al., 2004) can also be conceived of being expressions of discrete time sampling in the same temporal window. Furthermore, evidence on attentional control in the visual field suggests a stronger inhibitory function in the more peripheral relative to the perifoveal visual field indexed by a delayed response time by some tens of milliseconds corresponding to the numerical values observed in other experimental paradigms mentioned above (Bao & Pöppel, 2007). Taken together, a rather stable “temporal window” in cognitive processing is suggested which may provide a temporal frame which cannot be transcended in adaptive processes. Thus, the circular argument that temporal processing affects speech processing and speech processing affects temporal processing may only be true within “temporal windows” of neuronal processing that define temporal limits.

In both environments, stepwise information gain and the split-half heuristic identify the optimal question tree. In the Representative Environment (top left), Gender is the most informative first question; in the Nonrepresentative Environment (top right), Beard is the most informative first question. (The German word for beard, Bart, refers to various kinds of facial hair including a full beard, mustache, or chin-only beard.) The trees below the stimuli show the optimal (shortest expected path length) search trees for the Representative Environment (bottom left) and for the Nonrepresentative Environment (bottom right), as identified through exhaustive search. In the question trees, if the answer is “no” one takes the left branch; if the answer is “yes” one takes the right branch. Fig. 2 Average informational value (±SEM) of questions asked, on the Person Game and Number Game. At left, usefulness of all questions. At right, usefulness of the first questions. Children who had first completed the Number Game asked higher-information-value questions on the Person Game (left side). On both the left and right halves, the first two sets of data points (Repres. and Nonrep. Environ.) are from the Person Game; the third set of data points is from the Number Game. In the Person Game, the first questions were more informative in the Representative Environment than in the Nonrepresentative Environment. Optimal performance, denoted with the dotted lines, would correspond to scaled information gain of 1. Random performance is denoted with dashed lines. Data were obtained by first averaging each game for each child, then averaging all games for each child, and finally by averaging across children. The random strategy information value was obtained through simulation of a strategy that picks at random from the list of 20 available constraint questions. Including the hypothesis-testing (“name”) questions would reduce the information value of the random strategy. In the Number Game, arbitrary questions were allowed. In general, where there are n items and all questions are allowed, there are (2n – 2)/2 informative and non-redundant possible questions. With 18 numbers this entails 131,071 potentially informative and nonredundant questions. It is not clear what random strategy would be equivalent to the Person Game random strategy, so no random performance is calculated for the Number Game. Fig. 3 First questions asked in the Representative Environment (top) and the Nonrepresentative Environment (bottom). Split=initial feature distribution; IG=information gain. In each condition children received the same list of 20 constraint questions. In the Representative Environment, hypothesis-testing name questions (Theo, Herman) were asked a total of three times, although the name questions were not included in the set of suggested questions. Fig. 4 Proportion of Gender and Beard questions as first question in the two environments of the Person Game, in each round of the game. The data indicate strong effects of adaptation to the environment; these effects are apparent from the very first round of the game. The Gender question was much more frequent in the Representative Environment than in the Nonrepresentative Environment, and the Beard question was much more frequent in the Nonrepresentative Environment than in the Representative Environment.

Highlights • Children’s information search is most efficient in representative environments. • Statistical principles can quantify the value of children’s questions. • Games can foster generalizable insight into what makes questions useful. Abstract We investigated 4th-grade children’s search strategies on sequential search tasks in which the goal is to identify an unknown target object by asking yes–no questions about its features. We used exhaustive search to identify the most efficient question strategies and evaluated the usefulness of children’s questions accordingly. Results show that children have good intuitions regarding questions’ usefulness and search adaptively, relative to the statistical structure of the task environment. Search was especially efficient in a task environment that was representative of real-world experiences. This suggests that children may use their knowledge of real-world environmental statistics to guide their search behavior. We also compared different related search tasks. We found positive transfer effects from first doing a number search task on a later person search task.

In these situations, careful selection of questions to ask (or queries to make or experiments to conduct) is very important. Examples include a child asking a question to learn the meaning of a novel word, a scientist choosing an experiment to differentiate between competing hypotheses, or a person’s visual system directing the eyes’ gaze to informative parts of a visual scene. How do children and adults search for information? Many studies investigating information search have used variants of the “20-questions” game. In this game, the task is to identify an unknown target item by asking as few yes–no (binary) questions as possible. Much research has focused on the frequency of different kinds of questions in different age groups (Denney & Denney, 1973; Eimas, 1970; Mosher & Hornsby, 1966; Ruggeri & Feufel, submitted for publication; Thornton, 1982). Younger children tend to ask about specific objects (hypothesis-testing questions, e.g., “Is it Paul?”), or questions that, while phrased in terms of constraints, in fact pertain to individual objects (pseudoconstraint questions). An example would be asking “Does the person have a beard?” when there is only one person with a beard in the set. Older children tend to ask about properties that differentiate between subsets of multiple objects (constraint questions, e.g., “Is the person wearing a hat?”). Interestingly, one study found that elderly adults (M age =83) required 32 questions, whereas younger adults (M age =38) required only 18 questions on a related task (Denney & Denney, 1973). We study information search in fourth-grade (8–10year old) children, an age in which they begin to imagine two or three steps ahead in problem solving (Siegler & Stern, 1998) and playing games (Amit & Jan, 2006). They also develop skill at comparing simple proportions (Fischbein, Pampu, & Minzat, 1970; Martignon & Krauss, 2009; Tourniaire & Pulos, 1985). We investigate children’s sensitivity to the varying usefulness of constraint questions in different environments. 1.1 Theoretical background and the Person Game The goal in the Person Game, which we analyze mathematically and use in our experiment, is to identify an unknown target person by asking as few yes–no questions about the person’s features as possible. This equates to finding the question tree (binary decision tree) that has the smallest expected total number of questions. A question tree specifies which question is asked first, and depending on the answer to that question, what question is asked next, and so on (Fig. 1 ). In the Person Game, the available questions correspond to 20 physical features of the cartoon faces. The possible people are equally probable a priori. Suppose that the question is whether the (unknown) person is wearing a hat. If the answer is “no”, all persons with hats can be eliminated; if the answer is “yes”, all persons without hats can be eliminated. For large problems, such as person games with large numbers of people, it can be infeasible to use exhaustive search (which is NP-complete; Hyafil & Rivest, 1976) to identify the optimal question tree. We therefore also discuss stepwise information gain (Cover & Thomas, 1991; Lindley, 1956; Oaksford & Chater, 1996, 2003), a statistical model that is computationally simpler to implement. The highest-information-gain question is the question that, in the expectation after the question’s answer is known, will lead to lowest expected posterior uncertainty (Shannon, 1948, entropy). Reduction in uncertainty is considered information about the true category. In sequential search tasks, stepwise (greedy) procedures are not in general optimal. As descriptive models, information gain and related optimal experimental design ideas (like probability gain and impact) have been used to predict questions on a variety of tasks (Austerweil & Griffiths, 2011; Eimas, 1970; Markant & Gureckis, 2012; Meder & Nelson, 2012; Nelson, 2005, 2008; Nelson, McKenzie, Cottrell, & Sejnowski, 2010; Nelson, Tenenbaum, & Movellan, 2001; Oaksford & Chater, 1994; Oaksford & Chater, 2003), to predict human eye movements (Bicknell, 2011; Legge, Klitz, & Tjan, 1997; Meier & Blair, 2013;Najemnik & Geisler, 2005; Nelson & Cottrell, 2007; Walker Renninger, Coughlan, Verghese, & Malik, 2005), and to predict firing of individual neurons (Nakamura, 2006). In the Person Game each of the n persons is equally probable in the beginning. Let nyes denote the number of faces which have a particular feature, and nno denote the number of faces that lack that feature. The information gain (IG) of a question Q about that feature is: (1) IG ( Q ) = log 2 n - n no n log 2 n no + n y e s n log 2 n yes Information gain is defined in terms of a weighted average of logarithms. Are there simple strategies that could identify the highest-information-gain question? Consider the split-half heuristic. It finds a feature that comes closest to being possessed by half of the remaining individuals, and asks about that feature. Importantly, it can be proven that in the Person Game the split-half heuristic always chooses the highest-information-gain question (Navarro & Perfors, 2011). This finding contributes to a body of research showing that heuristic information-acquisition strategies can approximate (Gigerenzer & Gasissmaier 2011; Klayman & Ha, 1987; Markant & Gureckis, 2012; Slowiaczek, Klayman, Sherman, & Skov, 1992) or even exactly implement (Nelson, 2005, 2009) particular statistical models. Previous studies have found varying rates of use of the split-half strategy. Eimas (1970) found use of the split-half strategy varied widely depending on the number of target items, number of available constraint questions, and saliency of stimuli. Among 2nd graders, the proportion ranged from 0% to 19%; among college students, from 13% to 75%. 1.2 Transfer effects and generalizable insight Another important issue is whether intrinsically motivating games can instill generalizable intuitions about information-search strategies (“learning by playing”; Hirsh-Pasek & Golinkoff, 2003). Siegler (1977) began to explore this, by randomizing the order of structurally homologous letter and number guessing games, with 13–14-year-old children, in an experiment in which the use of informative question strategies was specifically encouraged. Siegler found that playing a number game beforehand led to improved performance on a letter game. He hypothesized that ordinal relationships among the numbers are more apparent than ordinal relationships among letters. We address whether positive transfer effects can occur between non-structurally-homologous games, in 8–10-year-old children, when instructions do not specifically encourage use of informative strategies. 2 Experiment Theoretically speaking, the immediate statistics of the set of cards available should determine the questions that are asked. However, it may not be easy to immediately internalize the full joint distribution of persons and features. This suggests that it would make sense for people’s ideas of questions’ relative usefulness to be influenced in part by their own prior experience with the statistics of faces in the world. To address this, we examined search behavior while manipulating the statistical structure of the faces in the Person Game (the environment), and therefore the structure of the optimal question trees. We used two statistical environments, a Representative Environment (Fig. 1, top left), with the gender distribution approximately equal (10 men, 8 women) and a Nonrepresentative Environment (Fig. 1, top right), in which the gender distribution was highly skewed (16 men, 2 women). We derived the globally-optimal question trees for each environment through exhaustive search (Fig. 1, bottom). In the Representative Environment, Gender is the most informative first question. In the Nonrepresentative Environment, Beard (facial hair), 1 The German word Bart was used in the experiment; it refers to various kinds of facial hair including a full beard (Vollbart), mustache (Schnurrbart), chin-only beard (Kinnbart), or goatee (Ziegenbart). 1 which is not a very useful question in the Representative Environment, is the best first question. The Nonrepresentative Environment is nonrepresentative in the sense that both the Beard and Gender feature proportions greatly differ from the real-world experiences of the children in our experiment, who have experienced roughly equal proportions of men and women, and only a minority of men with beards (cf. Nelson, 2005, Table 13). In both environments stepwise information gain and the split-half heuristic identified the optimal question tree. 2.1 Method 2.1.1 Participants and design Participants were 60 fourth-grade children between age 8 and 10 (67% girls) from Ludwigsburg, Germany, who were not familiar with the Guess Who ('Wer ist es?', by Hasbro) game from which the stimuli were taken. Factors “Person Game Environment” (Representative vs. Nonrepresentative) and “Order of Games” (Person Game First vs. Number Game First) were manipulated between subjects. 2.1.2 Materials and procedure Stimuli were printed on cards. For the Person Game the cards showed 18 cartoon-like faces, placed in random arrangement in front of the child (Fig. 1). The experimenter explained that she would draw a random person from an identical set of people (face cards) and that the child’s task was to identify this target by asking as few yes–no questions as possible about the person’s features. To make clear that each card was equiprobable, in each round of the game the cards were shuffled face down and a random target face card was chosen. The experimenter also explained that if the child needed help identifying a question, they could refer to twenty available questions (physical features), which were printed on a different set of cards and placed near to the child. The face cards eliminated through a question were turned over by the child, if needed with help from the experimenter. Questioning continued until the target was identified. Each child played five rounds of the Person Game. To explore the feasibility of using games to instill generalizable insight, we also included a non-structurally-homologous Number Game. The Number Game task was similar: to identify a randomly selected integer between 1 and 18, by asking yes–no questions. 18 number cards were ordered in front of the child. However, in the Number Game, arbitrary questions (pertaining to any subset of the numbers, e.g., “Is the number 7, 8, or 14?”) were allowed, 2 In this case, the Huffman (1952) code identifies the optimal tree, and exhaustive search is not required. 2 and no cards with possible questions were provided. The Number Game was played several times with random target numbers, for about 20min. 3 Results Because exhaustive search showed that stepwise information gain identifies the optimal question strategies in these environments, we use information gain to quantify questions’ usefulness. So that the best-available question always has a value of one, we report the scaled expected information gain (Hattori, 2002; Oaksford & Chater, 2003), which is obtained by dividing each available question’s information gain by the information gain of the most informative available question. Perfect use of the split-half heuristic leads to scaled information gain of 1 on every question. Children asked questions that were more useful than a chance strategy, but less useful than the optimal strategy, in both the Person Game and in the Number Game (Fig. 2 ). Aggregate performance in the Person Game (M =.87, Md =.88) and Number Game (M =.85, Md =.92) was similar. However, the Number Game performance spanned a much wider range (SD=.17, range .38 to .996) than the Person Game performance (SD=.05, range .74 to .98). An F test revealed that the difference in variance is statistically reliable (F(59,59)=11.05, p <.0001); bootstrap sampling (which is robust to nonnormality) corroborated this result. On the Person Game, children who had first played the Number Game asked higher-usefulness questions than children who played the Person Game first (t(58)=2.67, two-tailed p =.01, Cohen’s d= 0.69). There was no transfer from the Person Game to the Number Game (p =.83). Did children’s search behavior adapt to the statistical structure of each Person Game environment? While performance was high in both environments (Fig. 2), there was a trend to ask higher-usefulness questions in the Representative Environment (t(58)=1.66, two-tailed p =.1, d =0.43). To explore this trend, we analyzed children’s search separately with respect to the first question asked, and for the other questions. From a normative perspective, the first question is the most important. 3 When there are just two or three cards remaining, all informative questions have the same usefulness. In both environments, simulations show that the raw and scaled information gain of the random strategy increases gradually as the number of remaining face cards decreases. 3 When the first questions were excluded, questions’ mean scaled information gain did not differ between environments (M Representative =.89 vs. M Nonrepresentativ e =.90; p =.28). It thus appears that aggregate differences between environments were driven by the first question. Children asked higher-usefulness first questions in the Representative Environment than in the Nonrepresentative Environment (t(58)=3.82, p =.0003, d= 0.99; Fig. 2, right). The Spearman rank correlation between first question frequency and objective usefulness was .75 in the Representative Environment and .53 in the Nonrepresentative Environment. In each task environment the most informative first question was the most frequent first question (Fig. 3 ). Adaptation to the statistical structure of the task environment was seen from the first round of the game (Fig. 4 ). Learning from experience over repeated games was not required for that adaptation, although there may be a learning trend across the five rounds of the game. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of first questions for each environment, relative to the questions’ objective usefulness values. Gender was strongly preferred in the Representative Environment (55% of first questions), in which it is objectively most useful, but was also popular in the Nonrepresentative Environment (24% of first questions), where it has low information value. The Beard question was seldom asked in the Representative Environment (4% of first questions), even though it tied for second-most-useful, but was the most frequent first question in the Nonrepresentative Environment (25% of first questions), where it was the most useful question. 4 Discussion We observed a positive transfer effect from the Number Game to the Person Game. This shows that the games do not have to be structurally homologous for a facilitative transfer effect to occur, even among 4th grade children. Future research should explore a broad set of interventions (perhaps small-group discussion, experimenting with different physical arrangements of cards, etc.) to enhance attainment of generalizable insights. We found that information search was more efficient in a task environment that was representative of children’s real-world experiences. Our results suggest key issues for further theory and model development. Questions of varying information gain were asked. Could explore-exploit strategies, such as epsilon greedy or softmaxing (Sutton & Barto, 1998), together with the information value of the questions, explain this? These strategies entail occasional or proportional selection of low-information-value questions, and may be an important component of a full theory. However, they cannot explain why certain questions (e.g., Hat in both environments, Gender in the Nonrepresentative Environment) were much more prominent than other similarly low-information-value questions. Does salience explain the results? Unfortunately, salience is an umbrella idea that encompasses many findings. In eye movement experiments, features may become salient because of abstract physical properties (Itti & Baldi, 2006), or because they have been useful previously (Nelson & Chenkov, 2010). In our experiment, questions could also be popular because of additional goals—such as differentiating between male and female, which correspond to stable conceptual categories—that are beyond the current modeling framework. Perhaps the simplest explanation in the case of the Gender question is that the Nonrepresentative Environment statistics only partially overcame children’s real-world experiences. Suppose that a child assumed that 31% of the faces were female, halfway between the true 11% base rate and the psychologically plausible 50%. In this case the Spearman rank correlation between first question frequency and the scaled information gain would increase to .73 in the Nonrepresentative Environment, similar to the correlation in the Representative Environment. 4 We thank Reviewer 2 for suggesting this analysis. Note that in the case of nonequal priors, Eq. (1) cannot be used, but the general definition of information gain (Cover & Thomas, 1991; Nelson, 2005) still applies. 4 It is thus possible that the perceived proportion of female faces became closer to the true task statistics over repeated games, but that this shift was not dramatic enough to be apparent in the data. What are the implications? Most, but not all, of the above accounts imply that experiments with novel, artificial stimuli will understate the efficiency of information search in the wild. It is therefore important to learn the extent to which each of these explanations is correct. Naturalistic stimuli, the relative representativeness of which can be manipulated, were required for the manipulation in the present study. To differentiate among the alternate explanations, however, future experiments should orthogonally manipulate physical feature salience, individual subjects’ learning history, and the statistics of the immediate task environment. 4.1 Final thoughts Both theoretical issues in the study of information acquisition, and the design of future experiments, stand to gain from bringing sequential search experimental paradigms from developmental experiments and statistical insights together. We used exhaustive search to find that in our Person Game tasks the split-half heuristic does in fact identify the most efficient question strategies. However, this is not the case in general (Hyafil & Rivest, 1976). What search goals do people have if there is an unavoidable tradeoff between long-run efficiency and near-term information value? Meier and Blair (2013) found that people preferred a globally-more-efficient strategy, even if it entailed getting less information in the first query, in a situation in which a maximum of three queries were needed. In future research, one key theme to explore is whether, when, and how people identify efficient strategies in more complex sequential search tasks in which stepwise methods are suboptimal.

Panel A: A simulated response distribution (grey discs) from one participant (σ 2 =14.78, Participant 2, Experiment 2, in Trommershäuser et al., 2003a) aiming at the centre of a target (cross, Panel A). Panel B: Example of one stimulus configuration and reward structure employed by Trommershäuser et al., with example aim points (symbols) and region-specific rewards and penalties (numbers). Panel C: Hit probabilities for the aim points in panel B. Panel D: Efficiencies (expected gain normalized by optimal expected gain) for the aim points in panel B. The optimal aim point (circle) has an efficiency of 1. The horizontal line represents the lower 95 percentile of optimal performance. Efficiencies below this line are lower than expected by chance and hence sub-optimal. Fig. 2 Design of Experiments 1 and 2. Grey discs and crosses indicate potential target locations. Grey discs represent one possible target configuration. The white disc represents the dock from which all movements originated. The reward for hitting the large target was 50 in Experiments 1 and 75 in Experiment 2. In both experiments, the reward for the small target was 100 points, and the penalty for missing either target was -25. Note: targets are not drawn to scale. Fig. 3 Experimental procedure. Panel A: Possible stimulus configuration in Experiment 2. Panel B–F: Sequence of events as a trial unfolds. The number above the dock (white disc) represents participants’ cumulative score. Note: stimuli are not drawn to scale and the background was black and not white. Fig. 4 Response times: group averages (B, D) and individual participants’ averages (A and C) as a function of target distance, target size and experiment. The dashed line represents small targets and the full line represents large targets. The legend shows the radius of each target in pixels (1 pixel=.27mm). Error bars are within-subject 95% confidence intervals.

Highlights • Demonstrates limits on inferring human optimality from optimal models. • Human perceptuo-motor performance was contrasted with a standard optimal model. • Behavioral results and simulations show that the optimal standard is relative. • Task parameters and modeled constraints affect optimality classifications. • Limits on inference about optimality likely generalize beyond the tested model. Abstract Human high-level cognitive decisions appear sub-optimal (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Paradoxically, perceptuo-motor decisions appear optimal, or nearly optimal (Trommershäuser, Maloney, & Landy, 2008). Here, we highlight limitations to the comparison of performance between and within domains. These limitations are illustrated by means of two perceptuo-motor decision-making experiments. The results indicate that participants did not optimize fundamental performance-related factors (precision and time usage), even though standard analyses may have classed participants as ‘optimal’. Moreover, simulations and comparisons across our studies demonstrate that optimality depends on task difficulty. Thus, it seems that a standard model of perceptuo-motor decision-making fails to provide an absolute standard of performance. Importantly, this appears to be a limitation of optimal models of human behaviour in general. This, in conjunction with non-trivial evaluative- and methodological differences, suggests that verdicts favouring perceptuo-motor, or perceptual, systems over higher-level cognitive systems in terms of level of performance are premature. Keywords Decision-making Optimality Perceptuo-motor Motor planning 1 Introduction There appears to be a striking dissociation between human perceptuo-motor- and cognitive decision-making performance. Cognitive decision-making ability is widely viewed as distinctly less than optimal, because it conflicts with the normative prescriptions of decision theory that set out how ‘rational’ decision makers should behave (Birnbaum, 2008; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Perceptuo-motor decision-making, on the other hand, appears well described by the same theory (for a review see Trommershäuser et al., 2008; see Whiteley & Sahani, 2008 for a similar conclusion in a perceptual domain). This apparent dissociation has been highlighted repeatedly. Trommershäuser, Landy and Maloney, for example, note that “…in marked contrast to the grossly sub-optimal performance of human subjects in traditional economic decision-making experiments, our subjects’ performance was often indistinguishable from optimal.” (2006, p. 987; see also e.g., Maloney, Trommershäuser, & Landy, 2007; Trommershäuser et al., 2008). This performance dissociation is puzzling. Few reasons are evident for why perceptuo-motor decision-making should be optimal, while cognitive decision-making is sub-optimal (but see e.g., Chater & Oaksford, 2008; Evans & Over, 1996). Furthermore, little progress appears to have been made in explaining the difference. There are at least three possible sources for the apparent dissociation: (1) competence may be modality dependent (2) performance may be task dependent and (3) differences may result from the way performance is evaluated. If competence were indeed modality dependent this would be a striking finding. However, as pointed out by Trommershäuser and colleagues (e.g., Maloney et al., 2007), experimental paradigms across the two fields differ along a number of methodological dimensions. Perceptuo-motor studies generally involve repeated decisions with outcome feedback and internalized probabilities. Cognitive decision tasks, on the other hand, generally involve one-shot decisions without feedback and exact probabilities stated on paper (see e.g., Birnbaum, 2008; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, but see e.g., Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004; Thaler, Tversky, Kahneman, & Schwartz, 1997). Thus, a less interesting explanation is that one, or more, of these methodological differences give rise to the apparent dissociation. Not only are there methodological differences in tasks, performance is also evaluated differently in the two fields. Although both perceptuo-motor- and cognitive studies draw on normative theories to provide performance standards, adherence to these norms is assessed in different ways. Generally, the perceptual and perceptuo-motor literature asks how closely human performance matches that of an ideal agent (see e.g., Barlow, 1962; Geisler, 2003; Trommershäuser, Maloney, & Landy, 2003a, 2003b). Broadly, an ideal agent is a model that performs a given task maximally well. Constraints under which the system is assumed to operate are typically built into the model. The cognitive literature, on the other hand, typically asks if a system violates one or more of the axioms of decision theory (assumed fundamental principles of rational choice such as the transitivity of preferences, or independence of irrelevant alternatives, see e.g., Birnbaum, 2008; Hertwig et al., 2004; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Experiments are designed so that certain response patterns would constitute violations of these axioms, thereby indicating irrationality (i.e., sub-optimality). Thus, assessment of performance typically differs in two ways across cognitive and perceptual/perceptuo-motor studies: quantitative versus qualitative violations of normative theories and presence or absence 1 Studies of higher-level decision making and judgment typically are not concerned with constraints when evaluating participant performance. Instead it is assumed that the experimental task is sufficiently easy that any system that adhered to the studied axioms would in principle be able to perform the necessary computations (Evans, 1993). This is not to say that constraints have gone unstudied. Kahneman and Tversky (1996), for example, have argued that when extensional cues are given to participants, performance improves. This effect is presumed to be due to extensional cues triggering a slow and effortful processing system that would otherwise not have been used (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002). 1 of system constraints. Given these non-trivial differences between cognitive- and perceptuo-motor studies, comparisons of human performance across the two domains need to be made with care. In this paper we highlight difficulties associated with such comparisons using two perceptuo-motor decision-making experiments. The experiments demonstrate that minor changes in task parameters, specifically changes that do not affect an optimal agent’s performance, influence whether participants are actually viewed as optimal or sub-optimal. We follow up these empirical results by illustrating through simulations how specific changes in task parameters can cause participants hitherto classified as optimal to be classed as sub-optimal. Our experiments also suggest that people’s perceptuo-motor decisions are sub-optimal in ways not captured by Trommershäuser et al.’s (2003a, 2003b) model. Together these results, we think, suggest that claims of greater optimality for perceptual systems over higher-level cognitive systems may be premature. 2 Perceptuo-motor decisions & decision performance assessment The recent interest in comparing the relative optimality of cognitive and perceptuo-motor decisions stems from Trommershäuser et al.’s (2003a, 2003b) elegant perceptuo-motor decision paradigm. Their paradigm has made it possible to translate into perceptuo-motor tasks the kinds of decision problems given to participants in cognitive psychological studies. We begin with a brief introduction to Trommershäuser et al.’s paradigm. Because the perceptuo-motor system is noisy, speeded pointing towards a target will result in a response distribution dispersed around a chosen aim point (cross, Panel A, Fig. 1 ). Trommershäuser et al. exploit this noisiness to create perceptuo-motor decisions that are mathematically equivalent to standard cognitive decisions (such as those of e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). In Trommershäuser et al.’s (2003a, 2003b) paradigm, participants point towards stimulus configurations (Panel B, Fig. 1) under time pressure, with the goal of earning as many points as possible. Participants accrue points if they hit a reward region (full line, Panel B), lose points if they hit a penalty region (dashed line, Panel B), and incur both penalty and reward if they hit the intersection of both regions. Different aim points (different symbols, Panel B) will result in different probabilities of hitting each region (hit probabilities, Panel C). Different hit probabilities, in turn, will result in different numbers of points earned. Given that there are many aim points, participants are in effect choosing between many different options of the form: reward with probability p = X, penalty with p = Y, both reward and penalty with p = Z. This is easily recognized as a traditional decision-making problem (see e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). If participants are to maximize the number of points they earn, they have to find the aim point that will allow them to do so. Trommershäuser et al. (2003a) propose that people’s behaviour in these tasks can be explained by a process model that assumes that people solve this optimization problem and make optimal decisions. As noted in the introduction, the standard way of assessing performance in paradigms such as Trommershäuser et al.’s (2003a, 2003b) is to compare participants’ performance to that of an ideal agent. An ideal agent is an agent that performs the task maximally well. Of course, we should not expect participants (even if optimal) to precisely match optimal performance (e.g., because our estimates of their behaviour are noisy). Instead, the typical question is whether people are statistically distinguishable from optimal. Next, we describe how this is determined. First we need to determine the optimal choice for a given stimulus configuration (e.g., Panel B, Fig. 1). Given the response distribution of a specific participant (e.g., Panel A, Fig. 1), it is relatively straightforward to find what would be the optimal aim point. One simple method is to systematically move the response distribution around and evaluate the expected gain at each point, until a maximum is found. This simple method, and other more complex methods based on maximum likelihood estimation and numerical integration (Trommershäuser et al., 2003a), work because participants are assumed to control only the position of their response distribution – not its shape. 2 Harris and Wolpert (1998) showed that Fitts law (Fitts, 1954) is well accounted for by a model that assumes that movements are executed so that, given a specific movement duration, precision is maximized (or equivalently: movement duration is minimized given a precision constraint). Thus, to the extent that people maximize time use in perceptuo-motor decision-making tasks (as e.g., Trommershäuser et al., 2003a found, but see Gepshtein, Seydell, & Trommershäuser, 2007) it can be assumed that participants also maximize precision and therefore do not actively control the shape of their response distribution. If this assumption holds, precision (and equivalently - movement time) should be unaffected by, for example, the size of targets or verbal instruction in paradigms such as Trommershäuser et al.’s. This prediction applies because movement time is restricted, and using nearly all the available time will maximize precision, which in turn will allow targets to be hit more often, which in turn results in more money earned. However, for every-day reaching, in which the goal is to pick up an object, without a strong constraint on movement time, people are likely to reach to objects such that they can interact with them successfully (e.g., use more time, and so be more precise, when reaching towards a key than a pillow, see also e.g., Fitts, 1954). 2 Once the optimal aim point is found, the hypothetical optimal agent, having inherited the participant’s perceptuo-motor variability, “performs” the experiment many times (e.g., 100,000 times). The agent always chooses the optimal aim point. Effectively, one asks: “if this participant performed the same experiment again – but this time always chose the best possible aim point – how well would they do?” For each simulated experiment, the average earnings of the optimal agent are computed. This procedure results in a distribution of average (expected) optimal earnings (the agent’s earnings will vary due to the inherited perceptuo-motor variability), describing how many points an optimal agent is expected to earn in this particular experiment. As described below, this distribution can be used to infer whether participants are performing sub-optimally. To facilitate comparisons across experiments and participants, the earnings distribution of the optimal agent is divided by its mean. This generates an efficiency distribution, where an efficiency of 1 corresponds to the expected earnings of the optimal agent. Because of the modelled sensori-motor noise, even an optimal agent is likely to deviate from an efficiency of 1 in a particular experiment. Efficiencies below 1 mean that the agent performed worse than expected and efficiencies above 1 mean that the agent performed better than expected. By the same token, if participants were in fact optimal, their efficiency scores would likewise be distributed around an efficiency of 1. The above procedure estimates the distribution of earnings for the optimal agent. To infer whether a specific participant behaved sub-optimally, the efficiency of that participant is computed by dividing their earnings with the expected earnings of the optimal agent. The participant’s efficiency can then be compared to the 95% confidence interval on the optimal agent’s efficiency distribution. If the participants’ earnings lie below the lower bound of the confidence interval the participant is classed as sub-optimal (i.e., statistically distinguishable from optimal). 3 Of course, the logic of null-hypothesis testing implies that one cannot conclude optimality by this method. Strictly speaking, all one can do is to reject the null hypothesis of optimal performance, i.e., reject as optimal anyone who lies outside this interval. 3 In other words, when participants earnings are sufficiently unlikely to have been generated by an optimal agent they are classed as sub-optimal. Again, the example in Fig. 1 demonstrates this. Panel B shows a number of potential aim points: because of the cost incurred by hitting the penalty region, the optimal aim point is not the centre of the reward region (here represented by a cross), but rather a point shifted slightly away from the penalty region, specifically the point marked by the circle. The two aim points marked by triangles are shifted further from the penalty region than is optimal; aiming here further reduces the chances of hitting the penalty region, but makes it more likely that the reward region is missed altogether. However, only one of these – the rightward facing triangle – would result in the participant being classed as sub-optimal (see Panel D), because only it lies outside the lower confidence bound [straight line, Panel D]). Thus, due to the limited precision with which we estimate optimal performance, and because deviations from optimality might not be particularly costly, participants can deviate from the optimal strategy and still be classed as optimal. 3 Experimental investigation Using the paradigm just outlined, or variants thereof, Trommershäuser, Maloney and Landy have explored perceptuo-motor decision-making extensively (see Trommershäuser et al., 2008). We were interested in one of the distinctions they make: that of implicit and explicit decisions. Seydell, McCann, Trommershäuser, and Knill (2008) note that cognitive paradigms generally involve explicit choices (introspectively one is aware of choosing), whilst perceptuo-motor paradigms, such as the one outlined above, generally involve implicit decisions (introspectively one is unaware of choosing). Trommershäuser et al. have previously explored the explicit/implicit choice dimension in two studies (Seydell et al., 2008; Trommershäuser, Landy, & Maloney, 2006) – and concluded that both explicit and implicit motor choice are optimal, or near-optimal. In our two experiments, which were designed to explore this distinction further, participants made two choices per trial: an aim point choice (the “implicit” choice) and a target choice (the “explicit” choice). The paradigm is illustrated in Fig. 2 (see Methods for details). All pointing movements originated from a dock (the white disc in Fig. 2) and targets were displayed at different distances (crosses illustrate potential target locations in Fig. 2). On each trial, participants had to choose whether to attempt to hit a small or a large target. Participants’ response time was limited, which meant that small targets were more difficult to hit than large targets, and meant that far targets were more difficult to hit than nearer targets (Fitts, 1954; Schmidt, Zelaznik, Hawkins, Frank, & Quinn, 1979). Hitting a target incurred a reward and missing a target resulted in a penalty. The task goal was to earn as many points as possible. To earn as many points as possible, participants had to trade off the probability of hitting each target with the target’s value. The small target was always worth more than the large target. Target hit probabilities depended on participants’ aim point choices, their motor variability, the size of the target, and the distance to the target. A novel aspect of our study was that the expected gain (i.e., the average number of points received) for each target depended on the size of the target as well as its distance to the dock. Thus, a basic question was whether humans are able to trade off target size and target distance in an optimal manner when making perceptuo-motor choices. The use of two target sizes also enabled an indirect assessment of one of the assumptions built into Trommershäuser et al.’s model (2003a, 2003b): that the perceptuo-motor system minimizes motor variability. This assumption is critical because motor variability is fixed when deriving optimal predictions (as noted above in ‘Perceptuo-motor decisions & decision performance assessment’). Previous studies have also probed the question of human time allocation in perceptuo-motor tasks. The general conclusion has been that time allocation is optimal or near-optimal (e.g., Battaglia & Schrater, 2007; Dean, Wu, & Maloney, 2007; Hudson, Maloney, & Landy, 2008, and see Jarvstad, Rushton, Warren, & Hahn, 2012 for a comparison of time allocation across perceptual and cognitive domains). However, participants in those studies were explicitly instructed to optimize time usage. Consequently, this does not answer the question of whether the perceptuo-motor system optimizes time in general. First evidence that it may not can be found in the study of Gepshtein et al. (2007). Gepshtein et al. (2007) employed near and far targets and a response time criterion that was identical for near and far targets. In other words, participants could potentially spend just as much time reaching for near as for far targets. However, participants used less time when they reached for near targets compared to when they reached for far targets. Given the speed-accuracy trade-off (Fitts, 1954; Schmidt et al., 1979), it would appear that precision was sacrificed as reaches to near targets were faster than necessary. Since Gepshtein et al.’s results suggest that time allocation in motor responding may not be optimal without specific, explicit, instruction, further examination seems important. We conducted two experiments with the task just outlined. The task parameters differed across Experiments 1 and 2. Specifically, target size, target distance, number of possible target locations and the reward for the large target differed across the experiments. To state that the perceptuo-motor system is optimal (or nearly so), presumably implies that it can deal with a variety of situations that might occur – not that it is optimal for one particular target size or one specific set of rewards only. That is, if the perceptuo-motor system is optimal, one would expect it to be able to cope with the changing conditions across Experiments 1 and 2. In the following, we report on both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 simultaneously. This facilitates comparisons between the two experiments which should produce very similar results if behaviour is indeed optimal. As it turns out, however, seemingly innocuous changes in task parameters can have dramatic effects on whether participants are classed as optimal or sub-optimal. 4 Methods 4.1 Participants and instructions Sixteen (8 in each experiment) members of the Cardiff University Psychology participant panel were paid an hourly rate of £6 to participate, plus a performance related bonus based on their efficiency (efficiency*£6). The study had approval of the local ethics committee. Participants were informed of the reward structure in each experiment (that is, how many points could be earned by hitting each target, and how many were deducted for a ‘miss’). Participants were told to maximize their total score (“earn as many points as possible”). They were also told that they could receive an additional bonus (ranging between £0 and £6) depending on their performance (“the better you do the more money you will receive”). All participants were naive as to the purpose of the study. All had normal, or corrected to normal, vision and were fully mobile. Participants were fully informed about the experimental protocol. 4.2 Apparatus The experiments were written in Matlab (Mathworks, Inc.) and run with the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) on a Mac Mini (Apple, Inc.). Participants were seated in front of a pen display (Wacom DTZ-2100, Wacom Co. Ltd.) slanted at 65°. The pen display was used to display stimuli and record responses. Responses were made with the spring loaded eraser end of a standard Wacom stylus pen. Participants chose their distance and height relative to the display so as to enable natural pointing movements. 4.3 Stimuli, experimental design and procedure Fig. 3 (Panel A, see also Fig 2) illustrates a sample stimulus configuration. In both experiments, each stimulus configuration contained a dock (radius 16 pixels/∼4.3mm); this dock was the starting position for each trial and was displayed throughout the session. Two discs (potential targets), one large (Experiment1: radius 16 pixels/∼4.3mm; Experiment 2: radius 22 pixels/∼5.9mm) and one small (Experiment 1: radius 8 pixels/∼2.16mm; Experiment 2: radius 11 pixels/∼2.9mm), were displayed to the left of the dock (except for one left handed participant, for whom dock/targets were mirrored). On each trial, one disc was displayed along the upward diagonal (dotted line Fig. 3 Panel A) and one was displayed along the downward diagonal. In Experiment 1, discs were displayed at one of two distances relative to the dock: near (200 pixels/∼5.4cm) and far (900 pixels/∼24.3cm). In Experiment 2, discs were displayed at one of three distances: near (170 pixels/∼4.6cm), medium (340 pixels/∼9.2cm), or far (510 pixels/∼13.8cm). A full factorial combination of elevation (up/down), target location and non-target location resulted in 8 unique perceptuo-motor lotteries (i.e., stimulus configurations) for Experiment 1 and 18 unique lotteries for Experiment 2. Each experiment consisted of one practice session and one experimental session. Each session contained 44 trials per unique stimulus configuration. In the practice session no explicit (target) choice was made. Instead, a disc was designated as the target by the colour green (the non-target was red) and participants merely had to hit it. In the experimental session both discs were yellow and participants chose which disc to aim for. In Experiment 1, the small target was worth 100 points, the large target was worth 50 points and the background was worth −25 points. In Experiment 2, the reward associated with the large target was raised to 75 points, an alteration that should pose no problems for an optimal participant. Throughout the experiment, the participant’s cumulative score was displayed above the dock in blue numerals (Panel B–F, Fig. 3, – exemplified here by “175” and “275”). Participants initiated each trial by touching the dock with the stylus (Panel B), whereupon one of the unique stimulus configurations was displayed. Participants were required to maintain contact with the dock for 750ms (decision time, Panel C). A 550Hz tone signalled that movement should begin (Panel D). After the tone, participants had 550ms to attempt to hit their chosen target (Panel E). Participants received feedback both on where they hit the screen and on the amount of points earned on each trial (Panel F). They could rest at any time during the experiment simply by not initiating a new trial. Participants were told to respond within the 550ms interval, but they were free to move as fast as they wished within that upper bound. Responses that exceeded 550ms were recorded as ‘late’. Trials in which the stylus was lifted off the dock before 100ms had passed since the go signal were recorded as ‘anticipatory’. These limits on decision and response time match those of Seydell et al.’s (2008) study. Late and anticipatory responses resulted in feedback to speed up and slow down respectively and were rerun. Late and anticipatory responses were not penalized. For each trial, reaction time, movement time, response coordinates and the number of points earned were recorded. Reaction time was defined as the time from the go-signal to the lifting of the stylus pen off the dock area. Movement time was defined as the time from lifting the stylus off the dock area to contact with the tablet surface. Total response time was the sum of reaction time and movement time. Response coordinates were defined as the x and y position of the stylus upon first contact with the screen after the stylus had been lifted off the dock. 4.4 Data analysis The first block in the experimental session was viewed as a warm up block and was deleted prior to any analyses. Late and anticipatory responses were discounted (see e.g., Seydell et al., 2008). For the decision session, the mean proportion of late responses was .07 (SD=.06). The mean proportion of anticipatory responses was .07 (SD=.05). To assess participants’ overall performance (i.e., efficiency), a reliable estimate of movement variability is needed. The free choice component of the decision session meant that some targets (e.g., large near targets) had few or no data points. In order to guarantee a minimum of 20 data points for each precision estimate, data sets for each participant were created by adding the last 20 data points from the practice session to the decision data (for each target location and target size combination). The mean proportion of trials excluded as outliers in the merged data sets was .01 (SD=.016). Outliers were defined as data points further from the target centre than 2.5 times the large target radius (following Gepshtein et al., 2007). Responses were analysed separately for each participant and each factor. As in previous studies (e.g., Gepshtein et al., 2007; Trommershäuser et al., 2003a, 2003b) three assumptions were made. Firstly, it was assumed that the response distributions were bivariate normal, an assumption that we verified by inspecting chi square plots (Johnson & Wichern, 1998). Secondly, it was assumed that a participant selects a single aim point per target. As in past work, it was assumed that the centroid of each response distribution describes the aim point for that distribution. Any deviation from this aim point was assumed to be due to unexplained variability influencing planning (Churchland, Afshar, & Shenoy, 2006) and execution (van Beers, Haggard, & Wolpert, 2004) of movements. Finally, it was assumed that differences in biomechanical cost between targets were negligible (see e.g., Gepshtein et al., 2007; Trommershäuser et al., 2003a, 2003b). To describe participants’ pointing behaviour we use two metrics: aim point error and movement variability. Given a normal response distribution, circular targets and symmetric penalty regions (as employed here) the optimal aim point is the target centre. Aim point error describes the distance between a participant’s aim point (the centroid of each response distribution) and the target centre. 4 Defining aim point as the [x, y] coordinate of a maximum likelihood fitted bivariate Gaussian (cf., Gepshtein et al., 2007) produced equivalent results. 4 The lower the aim point error – the closer to optimal the aim point choice. Movement variability was defined as the mean distance of the movement end points from the centroid of the response distribution (see e.g., Gordon, Ghilardi, & Ghez, 1994). 5 Because movement data was anisotropic, defining movement variability as the standard deviation of the response distribution necessitates multi-variate dependent variables. Using Gordon et al.’s (1994) measure provides a univariate dependent measure, making analyses easier and the exposition clearer. Seydell et al. (2008) likewise adopted a univariate measure (the square root of the determinant of the covariance matrix) to describe the variability of anisotropic data. 5 Movement variability describes how variable participants’ pointing movements were (their perceptuo-motor variability). For every participant, we computed aim point error and movement variability separately for each target size and target location combination while collapsing across target elevation. We present both individual level plots as well as group averages for each analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA’s were used to test for group-level effects. When sphericity assumptions were violated, Greenhouse–Geisser corrections were used. We first report on how participants used the available response time. Thereafter we describe how movement variability and aim point choice related to target distance and size. Following this, data describing participants’ choices between the two targets (target choice) is presented. Finally, participants overall task performance is compared to that of an optimal agent. 5 Results 5.1 Overall response time Did participants use all of the available response time as in studies with only one effective reach distance (Trommershäuser et al., 2003a,b), or did they fail to maximize time usage as found in the one previous study, by Gepshtein et al., 2007, that involved different reach distances? As can be seen in Fig. 4 , participants used nearly all the available response time (550ms) when targets were far away. 6 Note that, because responses longer than the allocated response time are ‘timed out’ and discarded, the means must be lower than the maximal response time unless participants were able to perfectly match that response deadline on every trial. 6 However, for near and medium distance targets, participants used comparatively less of the available time, giving rise to a significant effect of target distance, Experiment 1: F(1,7)=85.14, p <.001, η p 2 =.92, Experiment 2: F(2,14)=247.15, p <.001, η p 2 =.97). This suggests that participants may not be maximizing time use, and therefore not be maximizing precision. If they had used the available time as efficiently as in the far condition there would be little difference between near and far targets, and the plots in Fig. 4 would show horizontal lines. Another trend worth noting is that participants appeared to use more of the available time when they reached towards small targets (dashed lines, Fig. 4) than towards larger targets (full lines, Fig. 4). The difference between response times for small and large targets was marginal in Experiment 1 (F(1,7)=4.87, p =.063, η p 2 =.41) and significant in Experiment 2 (F(1,7)=20.87, p =.003, η p 2 =.75). We did not detect an interaction between target size and target distance in Experiment 1 (F(1,7)=2.17, p =.184, η p 2 =.24), but did so in Experiment 2 (F(2,14)=5.92, p =.014, η p 2 =.46). For a detailed analysis breaking down the effects of response times into its separate components, reaction time and movement time, see Appendix A. 5.2 Movement variability Movement variability appears related both to target distance and size as shown in Fig. 5 . As expected, movements to far targets were more variable than movements to near targets (Experiment 1: F(1,7)=63.21, p <.001, η p 2 =.9, Experiment 2: F(1.2,8.4)=40.9, p <.001, η p 2 =.85). There was also evidence that movements were more variable for large targets than for small targets, with a main effect of size in Experiment 2 (F(1,7)=15.47, p =.006, η p 2 =.69), though not in Experiment 1 (F(1,7)=0.78, p =.41, η p 2 =.1) and a (marginal) interaction between target size and target distance in Experiment 1, F(1,7)=5.23, p =.056, η p 2 =.43 (Experiment 2: F(1.1,7.7)=.23, p =.668, η p 2 =.03). A direct comparison between near small targets and near large targets as the likely source of that marginal interaction (see Panel B, Fig. 5) shows that movements to large near targets were more variable than those to near small targets (t(7)=−4.14, p =.004); in other words, participants in Experiment 1 aimed with greater precision to small near targets than they did to large near targets. 7 There are trends in the data that suggest that for the furthest distance tested (Experiment 1, 900 pixels distance), the difference may disappear or even reverse (a trend that is also visible in the movement time plots, see Fig. 4). A possible explanation is that at very high difficulties participants relax their precision criteria even further (e.g., “there is no point in trying hard – it’s too difficult”). An alternative explanation is that the far distance employed in Experiment 1 was sufficiently far, given the time deadline, as to constrain the possible pointing strategies that could be employed (i.e., it was not possible for subjects to choose different movement times for these targets). 7 Thus both studies show evidence of effects of size and distance on movement variability (see also e.g., Chua & Elliott, 1993; Fitts, 1954). The result that movements to larger targets were more variable than movements to small targets, and that participants did not use all of the available time for near and medium distance targets (‘Overall response time’), suggests that the perceptuo-motor system does not always choose the optimal movement strategy as defined in Trommershäuser et al.’s model. Instead, the perceptuo-motor system may satisfice (Simon, 1959) end-point variance or optimise a more complex cost function, an issue we will be returning to below. 5.3 Aim point error The implicit choice participants made in our task was where to aim. ‘Aim point error’ (the distance between the participant’s aim point and the optimal aim point) indicates how well participants chose aim points. In contrast to movement variability (Fig. 5), aim point choice (Fig. 6 ) seemed less strongly influenced by target distance and size. Also in contrast to movement variability, there was little evidence of consistent patterns across participants. More specifically, aim point error showed no main effects of either size or distance in Experiment 1 (size: F(1,7)=.02, p =.9, η p 2 <.01, distance: F(1,7)=4.42, p =.074, η p 2 =.39), although there was a significant interaction (F(1,7)=12.18, p =.01, η p 2 =.64). In Experiment 2, there was a significant effect of size only, with aiming at larger targets worse than aiming at smaller targets (size: F(1,7)=10.46, p =.014, η p 2 =.60; distance: F(2,14)=2.45, p =.12, η p 2 =.25; size×distance interaction: F(2,14)=.86, p =.45, η p 2 =.11). In general, aim points rarely deviated from the target centre by more than 5 pixels (1.35mm), suggesting that participants’ aiming performance was good. 5.4 Target choice behaviour The explicit choice component of the task required participants to choose between a small and a large target. To characterise participants’ target choices, we compared the proportion of times the small target was chosen to the number of times it would have been chosen, had participants been optimal. In Fig. 7 , the proportion of small target choices is plotted as a function of the difference between the expected value for the small and large target (ΔEV). Participants should always choose the small target for positive ΔEV (a small choice proportion of 1), and always choose the large target for negative ΔEV (a small choice proportion of 0). Cumulative Gaussians have been fit to the individual data to assist the eye. If participants’ choices were perfect, these functions would match step-functions centred on the dashed lines at 0 ΔEV. The individual data (Experiments 1 and 2, Fig. 7), suggest that participants were sensitive to differences in expected gain, but not perfectly so. They generally picked the higher valued target. However, differences between the experiments are apparent. In Experiment 1, many participants appeared nearly un-biased - they chose small targets when these had higher EV’s and large targets when these had higher EV’s. In Experiment 2, on the other hand, most participants appeared biased towards the small target – choosing it even if doing so resulted in a loss relative to choosing the larger target. This is apparent in the fact that best-fitting functions appear shifted to the left of the dashed line at ΔEV=0. To characterise this apparent bias on a group level, we pooled the data by experiment and fit cumulative Gaussian density functions. As can be seen (Fig. 7), group level fits confirm the apparent trend and show that the small target bias is stronger in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 (as judged by non-overlapping 95 percentile intervals). This is noteworthy as participants appeared to have aimed for the harder-to-hit target even though aiming for the easier-to-hit larger target would have resulted in a higher return. 5.5 Task performance We used standard methods, briefly outlined below, to assess whether participants were optimal or not. See ’Perceptuo-motor decisions & decision performance assessment’ above for a detailed description and see Trommershäuser et al. (2003a, 2003b) for mathematical details. Overall performance depended on two choices – choice of aim point and choice of target. An optimal agent always picks the best target and aim point. As the response distributions were Gaussian and the penalty region symmetric (missing a target in any direction incurred a penalty), the optimal aim point was always the centre of each target. 8 It has been suggested that, because of optimizing biomechanical cost, the perceptuo-motor system is biased towards undershooting targets (e.g., Lyons, Hansen, Hurding, & Elliott, 2006). In this literature ‘undershoot’ is used to refer to the spatial location (primary movement endpoint) of the initial (more or less) ballistic phase of movements (Lyons et al., 2006, p. 97). Since our apparatus did not allow for reliable trajectory measurements (i.e., kinematics) it is impossible to say whether primary endpoints undershot targets. However, we can assess whether the actual endpoints (i.e., where the screen was hit) systematically undershot targets. Though we found some evidence of this type of undershooting, participants did not seem to consistently undershoot the target, which is in line with previous findings (e.g., Chua & Elliott, 1993; Fitts & Petersen, 1964). 8 For each participant, we simulated an optimal agent, who inherited the participant’s pointing variability, performing the experiment 100,000 times. The resulting distribution of average gains allowed us to estimate the expected gain of the optimal agent and the confidence in this estimate. If a participant’s performance lay outside the lower 95% confidence bound on the expected gain of the optimal agent, they were classed as sub-optimal. If participants performed better than this lower bound, they were classed as statistically indistinguishable from optimal. Fig. 8 shows participants’ efficiencies for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 (top and bottom panel, respectively). The first thing to note is that participants’ efficiencies are not distributed around an efficiency of 1 as would be expected if participants had been optimal, rather they are lower. Nevertheless, six of eight participants in Experiment 1 were within the bounds of optimal performance. In Experiment 2, on the other hand, only one of eight participants’ efficiencies was within the 95th percentile of the optimal expected gain. A Fisher’s exact test testing for differences in optimal performance rates across the two experiments is significant (p =.04). Likewise a Bayesian comparison of rates (Kass & Raftery, 1995; Lee & Wagenmakers, 2005) shows that, compared with the hypothesis that the rates of optimal performance is the same across the two experiments, the hypothesis that the rates differ across experiments is 10.7 times more likely. However, the absolute efficiencies across the two experiments are fairly similar. In other words, relative to the optimal agents, participants earned similar amounts in the two experiments. The lower bound on optimal performance, on the other hand, appears to be substantially lower in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2. Thus, the reason participants are classed as optimal in Experiment 1, but not in Experiment 2, appears to be due to differences in the confidence intervals and not due to differences in absolute efficiency levels. This is supported by statistical analysis. A Bayesian t-test (Rouder, Speckman, Sun, & Morey, 2009) comparing the absolute efficiency levels across the two experiments shows that there is insufficient evidence to conclusively favour either the null hypothesis that they are the same or the alternative hypothesis that absolute efficiencies differ (JZS Bayes Factor in favour of alternative hypothesis=.55, unpaired t-test, t(14)=−1.13, p =.28). However, the same test performed on the lower 95% confidence interval of optimal performance shows overwhelming support for the hypothesis that confidence bounds differ (JZS Bayes Factor=79438, unpaired t-test, t(14)=−9.68, p <1e−6). Thus, the difference in participant optimality across Experiments 1 and 2 appears due to a difference in how variable the optimal agent’s earnings were, and not due to different levels of absolute participant performance. 6 Discussion – Experiments 1 and 2 Regardless of whether participants were classed as sub-optimal or optimal, they were generally sensitive to the difference in expected gain between small and large targets and generally chose the target with the higher expected value. On the other hand, participants in Experiment 2 were biased towards choosing the small target, the target with the higher but more uncertain gain, even when this choice produced lower gains on average. Both experiments further suggest that participants’ perceptuo-motor behaviour may deviate from what is optimal in ways not captured by Trommershäuser et al.’s (2003a, 2003b) model. Firstly, participants appeared to favour speed over precision, producing movements to near targets that were faster than necessary. Given the speed-accuracy trade-off (Fitts, 1954; Schmidt, Zelaznik, Hawkins, Frank, & Quinn, 1979), such movements should decrease precision and therefore participants’ ability to hit targets. The model does not capture such apparent satisficing as it assumes that people’s movements maximize precision. Secondly, participants appeared to relax their precision criteria when aiming for larger targets. As Trommershäuser et al.’s model assumes that precision is maximized, participants are not penalised for their less-than-maximal precision, because it is the degree of precision they actually display that is ‘inherited’ by the optimal model. Hence an optimal model assuming that participants always minimize movement error in perceptuo-motor task may make participants appear more optimal than they really are: Points that are lost, because participants’ are hitting the targets less often than they could have done, do not enter into the comparison with the optimal agent. 9 Of course, participants not minimizing motor variability and/or not maximizing movement time does not, in of itself, imply that participants were sub-optimal. The experimental task did not demand that they do either, but that they earn as many points as possible. If participants were hitting the larger target 100% of the time, or were hitting the nearer targets 100% of the time, differences in movement time and variability would be largely irrelevant. However, even large near targets were not hit 100% of the time (see Appendix C for details). This means that participants could theoretically have improved their scores if they had minimized error and maximized movement time. 9 We followed this up in a control study (see Appendix B for details), where we tested whether participants could reach with equal precision to small and large targets when they were explicitly asked to do so. Under these conditions, three of five tested participants reached with equal precision to small and large targets. For these three participants, the null hypothesis of equal precision was more than three times as likely as the alternative hypothesis that the precision was unequal (JZS Bayes Factors>3), with the evidence for the two other participants being inconclusive. Consequently, the failure to reach to small and large targets with equal precision in Experiments 1 and 2 does not appear to be due to a capacity limitation. By simulating optimal agents who aim with equal precision to both target sizes, one can also show that the apparent precision-satisficing in Experiments 1 and 2 was consequential. Had participants been compared to such agents, their efficiencies would have dropped significantly relative to the standard analyses presented above (paired t-test, t(15)=−3.74, p =.002, mean difference=−.02). Most worryingly for claims about optimality, however, was the effect of seemingly minor changes to task parameter. Across Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the experimental set-up was identical, and both experiments required two kinds of choices: aim point- and target choices. However, the precise stimulus configurations and the reward structure differed across the experiments. Compared to Experiment 2, Experiment 1 had smaller targets, fewer target locations, target distance differences were greater and the difference between reward for the small and the large target was greater. It turns out that these differences in task parameters were highly consequential. Experiment 1 resulted in optimal participants, whereas Experiment 2 resulted in sub-optimal participants. This result implies that optimality standards as commonly employed are not absolute but relative (see also Section 11). Relative standards mean that classifying systems as optimal or sub-optimal is problematic without further clarification. For which experiment should we use if we wanted to evaluate the optimality of the perceptuo-motor system: Experiment 1 or Experiment 2? We next explore the effects of particular task parameters on the two sub-components of our task in greater detail. 7 The effect of task parameters on performance metrics The key result of Experiments 1 and 2 was that seemingly innocuous changes in task parameters such as target size result in very different verdicts on optimality. Next, we simulate the effects of changes in task parameters to explore in greater detail how such changes might affect sub-optimal participants. We focus on three properties of the tasks: hit probability, rewards and the total number of trials experienced. Note that, although we simulate changes in hit probability by manipulating target size, the same effects can be achieved by instead changing target distance (Fitts, 1954; Schmidt et al., 1979). That is, changes in hit probability can be brought about by either changing target distance or target size. However, simulating changes in target distance would require extrapolating beyond the data we have available, whereas simulating a change in target size merely requires changing a task parameter (given the assumptions of the model, i.e., that precision is maximized). First, we consider how task parameter changes impact on participants’ efficiency separately for the implicit and the explicit choice component. Then, we explore which changes across Experiments 1 and 2 are likely to explain why most participants were classed as optimal in the first experiment but not the second. 8 Task parameters and the optimality of aim point choices Fig. 9 illustrates the effect of changing target size on the implicit component. Panel A shows the optimal aim point (cross) with sample hit points (grey discs) as well as two sub-optimal aim points (triangle and square). As target size increases, naturally so does the likelihood of hitting the target (Panel B), whether a participant is optimal (full line) or sub-optimal (triangles and squares). Panel C shows the hit probability for the two sub-optimal aim points as a proportion of the optimal hit probability (i.e., as efficiency). It appears that sub-optimal aiming becomes less costly in terms of absolute efficiency as target size increases. However, as noted above, whether or not behaviour is considered optimal depends not on absolute efficiency, but the relationship between absolute efficiency and the variability of the optimal agent. Panel D shows the lower 95% confidence bound on the optimal agent’s hit efficiency (dashed line). When either of the two sub-optimal aim points (triangles, squares) results in efficiencies above the dashed line, participants are classed as optimal. Conversely, efficiencies below the dashed line imply that participants are sub-optimal. As can be seen in Panel D, smaller targets lead to more variable optimal agents (and thus wider CI’s). This means that small targets allow for greater deviation from the optimal aim point before participants are classed as sub-optimal. How do these simulations fit with the results of Experiments 1 and 2? Targets in Experiment 1 were smaller than targets in Experiment 2. This means that sub-optimal participants should have been more likely to be classed as optimal in Experiment 1. This is precisely the pattern of results obtained. There were significantly more optimal participants in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2, and this contrast appeared driven by differences in confidence intervals rather than differences in absolute efficiencies. However, we will return to the issue of the confidence interval difference between Experiments 1 and 2 below, and show that changes in target size are likely to have accounted only for a small part of the total effect. 9 Task parameters and the optimality of target choices We next examine how a change in hit probability affects the explicit choice component of our task: the participant’s choice between the small and the large target. Fig. 10 illustrates the effect of changing target size and the resultant change in hit probability on target choice. In the simulation, we set the size of the large target such that the hit probability is close to 1 and then vary the size of the smaller target. Panel A illustrates the effect of this manipulation on hit probabilities for the small target (dashed line) relative to the large target (full line). As we increase the small target’s size (i.e., increase the small/large target ratio), it becomes increasingly easy to hit (hit probability increases). Of course, for choosing between the small (dashed line) and the large target (full line), knowing hit probabilities alone is not sufficient; one also needs to know the rewards associated with each target in order to identify the target with the greater expected value. Panel B (Fig. 10) shows the number of points a participant can expect to earn for each target given the reward structure of Experiment 1. ΔEV is the difference in expected value between the small and large target. If it is positive, the smaller target would yield greater gains on average and should be chosen (if negative, it is the large target that promises better returns). As can be seen from the graph, the large target should be chosen for a small-to-large target size ratio of up to about .4, as its expected value is higher in this range. With further increases in the size of the small target, the participant should switch and choose the small target. Of course, to choose the more highly valued target, the participant must recognize the differences in expected value. The black step-function in Panel C (Fig. 10), illustrates the behaviour of an optimal agent who does this perfectly, and so fully maximizes expected value (as in Trommershäuser et al.’s 2003a, 2003b model). Such an agent will always choose the small target when its expected value is higher (in which case the proportion of small target choices is 1), and choose the large target when its expected value is higher. The shape of the resultant step-function is illustrative of the generally all-or-none prediction of maximization theories such as expected utility. However, people’s ability to resolve differences will be limited in practice: some differences will simply be too small for the system to detect, thus making participants less than perfectly sensitive to differences in expected value. Consequently participants are unlikely to exhibit such perfect sensitivity, though one would expect better choices when ΔEV is large (because it should be more readily apparent which of the two targets is better, see e.g., Mosteller & Nogee, 1951; see also Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2008, for this idea applied to model evaluation). The grey function in Panel C of Fig. 10 illustrates a participant who is less-than-perfectly sensitive to differences in expected value (ΔEV). The cross in Panel B and C, illustrates a particular choice situation in which the optimal response is to choose the small target. The less-than-perfectly sensitive participant (grey line) will only pick the optimal target ∼80% of the time – leading to a loss relative to the ideal agent (black line). From the grey function, it should also be clear that as the absolute ΔEV becomes larger, the optimal agent and the sub-optimal agent become increasingly similar. How does this all relate to the explicit choices in Experiments 1 and 2? Given that people are likely to be less-than-perfectly sensitive to differences in expected value, we would expect better choices in the experiment that had the largest expected value differences. In Experiment 1, the difference between the small and large target reward was greater, and the differences in target distance (and hence hit probabilities) were greater, than those in Experiment 2. This should mean that, on average, Experiment 1 had choice options that were more different than those in Experiment 2. The mean absolute difference in expected value was indeed greater in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2 (unpaired t-test, t(13)=2.74, p =.017, mean difference=4.23 10 One outlier ∼2.5 inter-quartile ranges from the median in Experiment 2 was excluded. 10 ). Thus, for anyone who is less-than-perfectly sensitive to ΔEV differences, Experiment 1 is easier than Experiment 2. One indication, that the explicit choice was indeed easier in Experiment 1, is that the proportion of choices that maximized expected value was greater in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2 (unpaired t-test, t(14)=3.86, p =.0017, mean difference=.218). 10 Task parameters and the bounds of optimal performance in overall evaluation So far, we have explored separately the effect of individual task parameters on the two choice components, but what about their combination? Do these parameters interact and which is most influential in bringing about the differing verdicts on optimality across the two experiments? Participants’ absolute efficiencies were comparable in the two experiments, yet participants were classed as optimal in Experiment 1 and sub-optimal in Experiment 2. The crucial difference seemed to be the confidence intervals on the optimal agents’ performance (see Fig. 8 above). The confidence intervals are used to infer whether or not participants are optimal. The wider confidence intervals in Experiment 1 therefore meant a more lenient standard of optimality. What could account for the different standards of optimality? The two experiments differed in seemingly innocuous ways. Target distances, target sizes and the reward structure were slightly different across the two experiments. However, one additional factor could be of importance here. A further variation between studies was the number of stimulus configurations (i.e. distinct decision problems). Manipulating the number of distinct choice configurations (here: 8 in Experiment 1 and 18 in Experiment 2), whilst keeping the number of trials for each configuration constant, results in a different number of total trials. Specifically, the total number of trials was substantially greater in Experiment 2 (44*18=792) compared to Experiment 1 (44*8=352). Everything else being equal, a greater sample size leads to tighter confidence intervals, so that this also needs to be considered. In short, the different widths of the confidence intervals could potentially be accounted for by changes in target size (and/or distance), changes in rewards and/or changes in total sample size. We explored the effect of these factors by simulation. We simulated the eight optimal agents of Experiment 2 (one for each participant) under conditions that were made increasingly similar to those of Experiment 1. The variable of interest is how the lower 95% confidence bound on the optimal agents’ efficiency changes when the various task parameters change. In other words – how do changes in task parameters affect the chances that a sub-optimal participant is classed as optimal? Fig. 11 shows the original tight confidence bound from Experiment 2 (gray discs, ‘Exp. 2’) for each optimal agent (1–8, x-axis). The other symbols show the result of varying the degree of similarity between Experiment 2 and Experiment 1. The difference, between the original bound (gray discs) and the other bounds, is a measure of the effect size of a particular change. The shaded region in Fig. 11 is the between-subject 95% confidence interval on the lower confidence bound from Experiment 1. If the two experiments were identical we would expect the bounds from Experiment 2 (or the simulated variants) to lie in this region. For the first simulation (crosses, Fig. 11) we equated the number of total trials across the two experiments. This was achieved by excluding from Experiment 2 the mid-distance targets – creating an experiment with four possible target locations (like Experiment 1). This resulted in Experiment 2 having the same number of total trials as Experiment 1, but with different rewards and different target sizes. As can be seen, the crosses that illustrate this change (Fig. 11) deviate only marginally from the original confidence bound – suggesting that the total number of trials is relatively unimportant in explaining the difference in confidence bounds across Experiments 1 and 2. For the next three simulations, the number of total trials was kept the same as those in Experiment 1. For the second simulation, we additionally changed the target sizes to match those of Experiment 1 (stars, Fig. 11). This also had only a marginal effect on the confidence bounds. For the third simulation, we changed the rewards (but not target size). This appears to have an appreciable effect on the confidence bounds (triangles, Fig. 11). For the final simulation, in addition to equating the total number of trials, we replaced both the target sizes and the rewards in Experiment 2 with those from Experiment 1. This resulted in the largest drop in the lower confidence bound (squares, Fig. 11). In fact, the lower optimal bound for many participants is now within a range we would expect from Experiment 1 (shaded region, Fig. 11). The slight underestimation of variability relative to Experiment 1 (shaded area) is possibly due to the fact that far targets were nearer in Experiment 2 (this difference could not easily be simulated 11 As noted in the introduction to this simulation section, we would have to extrapolate beyond the current data to simulate the effect of changes in target distance and so treat such differences as noise here. To the extent that the confidence bounds converge as experiments are made more similar this imperfection is of little relevance. 11 ). Because targets were nearer, they also were easier to hit (a greater proportion had hit probabilities close to 1), and therefore should result in less variable gains, which lead to tighter confidence intervals. It is perhaps surprising that the effect of roughly doubling the number of trials has such a relatively minor effect on the width of the confidence bounds. However, what matters is the variability on the overall gain in an entire experiment. This variability depends not only on the confidence intervals for hit-probabilities of particular targets (as illustrated in Fig. 9), but also on the specific combinations of rewards, penalties and hit probabilities across targets. As Fig. 11 illustrates, these factors may interact in ways that are difficult to predict. To illustrate this further, consider two hypothetical instantiations of our experimental task. In both instantiations, the optimal agent is faced with two target pairs. For each pair, the agent chooses the optimal target 40 times. In Experiment A, the rewards for hitting the two optimal targets are 259 and 10 points respectively. In Experiment B the rewards for the optimal targets are 115 and 100 points respectively. In both experiments the penalty for missing is −5 points, and the higher valued target is harder to hit than the lower valued target (probability of hitting the high value target p =.5; probability of hitting the low value target p =.8). An optimal participant would, on average, earn the same number of points in both experiments (134 points). However, the confidence interval on the expected gain will be very different. In fact, Experiment A will result in confidence intervals almost twice the width of Experiment B: namely, a width of approximately 80 points versus a width of approximately 45 points. By imposing a different reward structure, a change that will not affect a strictly optimal participant, we have made it much more likely that a sub-optimal participant be classed as optimal. The previous simulations illustrate that one can, as we did, illustrate some of the potential problems of categorizing participants as optimal or sub-optimal by breaking down the effects of particular changes in task parameters, but the final verdict on whether people are optimal or not, depends on task parameters that interact in ways not easily foreseen. 11 General discussion It has been suggested that the perceptuo-motor system makes optimal, or near-optimal, decisions in tasks that require both explicit target choice and implicit aim point choice (Seydell et al., 2008; Trommershäuser et al., 2006). Using a novel perceptuo-motor decision task, we found that this was the case for one set of task parameters (Experiment 1), but not for another set of task parameters (Experiment 2). Even in Experiment 1, where participants were mostly classed as optimal, participants’ efficiencies were consistently lower than 1. That is, efficiencies did not cluster around 1 as expected if participants had been optimal. We argued that the likely origin of the difference in performance between Experiments 1 and 2 was a more lax criterion of optimality in Experiment 1. The change in criterion for optimal performance followed innocuous changes in task parameters, such as changes in target size and target reward. These parameter changes do not affect the expected performance of an optimal agent and therefore do not affect participants who are truly optimal. Yet, the changes had dramatic effects on whether participants were classed as optimal. Through simulations, we showed that task parameter dependent optimality is a general problem that extends beyond the specific parameters of our experiments. Furthermore, departures from optimality were evident in the raw data itself. Participants reached with greater precision to small targets than to large targets, which suggests that humans sometimes satisfice rather than maximize precision. Moreover, we showed that the apparent failure to maximize precision was consequential. Had participants been compared to optimal agents who aimed with equal precision to both target sizes, their efficiencies would have been lower than the ones reported here. We further established that participants seem capable of reaching with equal precision to small and large targets when they are explicitly asked to do so. Similar to Gepshtein et al. (2007), we also found that participants did not make use of all the available response time when pointing to near targets. Whatever the source of this time under-utilisation, it is likely sub-optimal in the present tasks. Spending more time on harder-to-hit targets should increase the likelihood of hitting those targets (Fitts, 1954; Schmidt et al., 1979), leading in turn to greater earnings. Both of these limitations in performance suggest that it may be more appropriate to view performance as sub-optimal, and they highlight the model-dependency of optimal agent-based comparisons. Neither the failure to maximise precision when reaching to large targets, nor the failure to use all available response time when reaching to near targets, both which likely impeded participants’ performance, are captured when precision-maximization is assumed as in Trommershäuser et al.’s (2003a, 2003b) optimal agent model. Instead, the optimal agent simply inherits the participants’ actual variability in hitting targets. The deeper problem, here, concerns which constraints and cost assumptions to include in one’s model. It might be possible to build optimal agents based on independent assessment of how precise participants’ pointing behaviour could be if they were performing at their maximal level. Conversely, one might also assume that participants are optimizing a different cost function; if this function (whatever it is) were to be used for analysis instead, one might potentially be tempted to label their actual precision as optimal. However, there are clear conceptual limitations that arise here: If one includes all the factors influencing behaviour then ‘optimality’ seemingly follows by definition: limitations in performance are simply translated into system constraints and/or appropriate trade-offs between (subjective) costs. In the limit, findings of optimality become trivial and cease to be of theoretical interest. Methodologically, it may be invaluable to assume optimality and iteratively seek to incorporate constraints as a way of understanding the workings of the system. Ideal observer analysis (Geisler, 2011) and rational analysis (Anderson, 1990) can be used in this way: to, for example, constrain the search for plausible models (see e.g., Schrater & Kersten, 2002) and to facilitate the design of process models (see, e.g., Howes, Lewis, & Vera, 2009). Such methodological use of optimal models, however, should be distinguished from contexts where substantive statements about optimality per se (or lack thereof) are at stake. Such statements are frequent in the literature, whether they are phrased in terms of system optimality or, as is more common in the cognitive and social literature, in terms of ‘rationality’. The statements discussed in the introduction, which contrast the degree of optimality between perception and cognition, provide just one small sample of such claims. The results presented in this paper, make clear how difficult such claims are to establish and sustain. A given empirical assessment of human decision-making performance necessarily involves a specific task that determines how difficult the decision problem is. Everything else being equal, an easier task will naturally lead to a more optimistic view of human decision-making performance compared with a harder task. To illustrate task difficulty, consider a choice pattern that violates maximization of expected value. When asked to choose between a gamble that yields $2500 with a .33 probability, $2400 with a .66 probability and $0 with a .01 probability and a gamble that yields $2400 with certainty, most tend to pick the latter (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, pp. 265–266). The expected value of the former is $2409 and the expected value of the latter is $2400. This may be deemed sub-optimal, yet the expected loss of choosing the modal response is only 0.4%. Moreover, assuming noisy computational processes (Faisal, Selen, & Wolpert, 2008), people might not even be able to distinguish between expected values that differ so little. It may seem obvious that comparing performance across tasks that vary in difficulty is problematic. Nevertheless, there has been little attempt to equate decision-problems when making comparisons across modalities or cognitive domains. When such attempts have been made, little – if any – difference in performance has been found (see Jarvstad, Hahn, Rushton, & Warren, 2013; Jarvstad et al., 2012; Wu, Delgado, & Maloney, 2009). Furthermore, the issue is not limited to comparison such as that between perception and cognition. All performance evaluations are inherently relative to the tasks that make up the evaluation. Consequently, the evaluations they provide are relative, not absolute. Optimality analyses that evaluate performance relative to an optimal agent do not circumvent this limitation, rather they compound it, because such model-dependent comparisons depend also on the constraints included in the optimal agent. 12 Sometimes it is argued that some ideal observer models do provide absolute standards (e.g., Ma, 2012), provided that the models are defined relative to the information available at the sensory stage (e.g., the retinae). However, even these models are conditioned on something – the constraints of the sensors. It seems to us that there is no principled reason for thinking that this particular constraint - the sensors being the way they are - is any different to any other constraint, for example a particular cortical structure (e.g., V1) being the way it is. In fact, recently the opposite argument has been made: that higher cortical structures have constrained the evolution of our eyes (Beck, Ma, Pitkow, Latham, & Pouget, 2012). Regardless, modelling any constraint, whether at the sensor- or later levels, implies that performance standards are relative (to those constraints) and not absolute. Nevertheless, fully unconstrained models can perhaps be specified. For light detection, this may involve conditioning on the whole light spectrum – not just the one that is visible to our retinae. Similarly, for the motor system such an unconstrained model might have no constraints on precision and speed. In both cases, it seems unlikely that the system would perform optimally given such an unconstrained model. 12 That statements about optimality are specific and conditional in this way – that is, a behaviour is optimal given a task of this difficulty, and given these capacity constraints included in the optimal agent— may be appreciated by many, however the literatures typically do not make this explicit, and many claims are simply unsustainable once this fact is taken into account. The fact that performance evaluations are always task relative makes comparative evaluations across systems difficult. The surprising extent to which results reported in this paper further reveal statements about optimality to be sensitive to task parameters that are unlikely to be the focus of attention compounds these difficulties. As we have shown, it is possible to make people appear optimal, or sub-optimal, by seemingly innocuous changes to decision-making tasks, because changes to task parameters have consequences for the confidence intervals delineating optimal performance in ways that are difficult to foresee. Consequently, a comparable level of performance can lead to opposite verdicts on optimality across tasks. In conclusion, our results suggest that statements about optimality, both within and across domains, are likely to be considerably more fragile than the literature presently assumes.

Here we break down the response times into its two separate components: reaction time and movement time and analyse them separately. A.1 Movement time As can be seen in Fig. A1 , movement times show approximately the same pattern of results as the overall response times (movement time+reaction time) reported on in the main paper. When participants point to far targets they use more time than when pointing to near targets (Experiment 1: (F(1,7)=120.68, p <.001, η p 2 =.95, Experiment 2: F(2,14)=289.28, p <.001, η p 2 =.98). Recall that the time available for each pointing movement was the same regardless of distance. If participants had used nearly all the available time (550ms) to point at targets, the plots in Fig. A1 would have been horizontal lines. Faster movement times for nearer targets, compared to far targets, suggests that movements to near targets were faster than necessary. Another interesting trend is that participants moved more slowly towards small targets than they did to large targets (Experiment 1: F(1,7)=21.31, p =.002, η p 2 =.75, Experiment 2: F(1,7)=41.81, p <.001, η p 2 =.86). Given the speed-accuracy trade-off (Fitts, 1954; Schmidt et al., 1979) this also suggests that people were sacrificing precision for movement speed. In Experiment 1 there was also a significant interaction F(1,7)=9.54, p =.018, η p 2 =.58), whereas in Experiment 2 it did not reach significance (F(2,14)=41.81, p =.09, η p 2 =.29). A.2 Reaction time Reaction times for most participants show the opposite, albeit weaker, trend to that of movement time. Firstly, reaction time decreases with increases in target distance (Experiment 1: F(1,7)=11.32, p =.012, η p 2 =.62, Experiment 2: F(2,14)=20.01, p <.001, η p 2 =.74). Thus, participants to some extent appear to trade-off movement time with response time, initiating movements faster to targets that are far away. Secondly, for some participants reaction times to small targets are slower than reaction times to large targets. This trend was significant in Experiment 2 (F(1,7)=8.125, p =.025, η p 2 =.54) and marginal in Experiment 1 (F(1,7)=4.92, p =.06, η p 2 =.41). In Experiment 1 there was also a significant interaction (F(1,7)=5.72, p =.048, η p 2 =.45), whereas none was detected in Experiment 2 (F(2,14)=.376, p =.693, η p 2 =.05) (Fig. A2 ). Appendix B Is target size-independent precision achievable? Here we give brief details on the small control study reported on in ”Discussion – Experiments 1 and 2”. Only significant deviations from Experiments 1 and 2 are noted. B.1 Method B.1.1 Participants and instructions Five participants took part. All participants (except Participant 2 who was the first author) were paid at an hourly rate of £10. Participants were informed that speeded movements are variable and that even if one aims for the same spot on each reach, the actual end point will deviate randomly from trial to trial. They were further informed about the difference between accuracy and precision. Participants were instructed to minimize the distance between each end point and the perceived target centre. All participants (except Participant 2) were naive as to the purpose of the study. B.1.2 Stimuli, experimental design and procedure On each trial, one target disc was displayed to the left of the dock at a distance of ∼9.2cm (340 pixels) at one of five angles (−15°, −7.5°, 0°, +7.5°, +15°). Targets were either small (radius ∼2.9mm/11 pixels) or large (radius ∼5.9mm/22 pixels) yellow discs. On each trial a random target size and target angle was selected for presentation. In total, 300 small and 300 large non-late and non-anticipatory trials were collected. Participants received feedback identical to that in Experiments 1 and 2 on where they hit the screen (but did not receive any points for hitting the targets as we wanted to minimize the incentive for satisficing). B.1.3 Data analysis and results For each participant we collapsed across target angle, creating one small target and one large target distribution (see Gordon et al., 1994). On a group level, there was a very small but detectable effect of target size on movement time (t(4)=4.18, p =.014, mean difference=4.2ms), indicating that movements to smaller targets were marginally slower than movements to large targets. We did not detect an effect of target size on either response time or reaction time (t(4)=1.02, p =.37, mean difference=1.6ms; t(4)=2.51, p =.066 , mean difference=5.9ms). We compared each participant’s movement variability for small targets to their movement variability for large targets using un-paired t-tests. The t-statistic was used to derive JZS Bayes Factors (Rouder et al., 2009), which allow inferences in favour of the null hypothesis (movement variability does not differ across target size) as well as in favour of the alternative hypothesis (movement variability does differ across target size). Three of five participants reached with equal precision to small and large targets (JZS Bayes Factors>3) and the evidence for two of five participants was inconclusive. If one performs the same analyses on the data for Experiments 1 and 2, the results are markedly different – most participants reached with greater precision to small targets (12 of 16, JZS Bayes factors<0.33) and only three of sixteen participants reach with equal precision to small and large targets (JZS Bayes Factor>3). A group-level analysis provides similar evidence, showing that participants had a lower average difference (between small and large targets) in movement variability compared to those in Experiments 1 and 2 (t(19)=3.86, p =.001, mean difference=1.33). 13 There are two potential issues with directly comparing Experiment 3 with Experiments 1 and 2. Firstly, Experiment 2 generally had more data than Experiment 3 (where there were 300 large and 300 small target samples). A reviewer also questioned whether precision differences may be affected by target distance (in Experiment 3 one mid-distance was used, whereas Experiments 1 and 2 used two and three different target distances respectively). As a control, we therefore fit bivariate Gaussians to the mid-distance data in Experiment 2 (the same distance as used here). The parameters of these maximum-likelihood fits were used to simulate participants in Experiment 2 reaching, the same number of times as here, to mid-distance targets only. Even when distance and sample size has been equated, the average precision difference between small and large targets is larger in Experiment 2 than here (t(11)=3.7, p =.003, mean difference=.96). 13 Appendix C Target hit probabilities See Fig. C1 .

Highlights • We presented subliminal primes in a modified Go/NoGo task. • Participants acted or inhibited an action, based on either instructions or their own free choices. • Subliminal primes could bias ‘free’ choice to act or inhibit. • Priming effects at inhibitory latencies were stronger than at facilitatory latencies. • Conscious, volitional self-control can be influenced by subtle external stimuli. Abstract Intentional choice is an important process underlying human behaviour. Intentional inhibition refers to the capacity to endogenously cancel an about-to-be-executed action at the last moment. Previous research suggested that such intentional inhibitory control requires conscious effort and awareness. Here we show that intentional decisions to inhibit are nevertheless influenced by unconscious processing. In a novel version of the Go/No-Go task, participants made speeded keypress actions to a Go target, or withheld responses to a No-Go target, or made free, spontaneous choices whether to execute or inhibit a keypress when presented with a free-choice target. Prior to each target, subliminal masked prime arrows were presented. Primes could be congruent with the Go or No-Go arrows, or neutral. Response times and proportion of action choices were measured. Primes were presented at latencies that would give either positive or negative compatibility effects (PCE, Experiment 1, and NCE, Experiment 2, respectively), based on previous literature. Go-primes at positive-compatibility latencies facilitated speeded response times as expected, but did not influence number of choices to act on free-choice trials. However, when Go primes were presented at negative-compatibility latencies, “free” decisions to inhibit were significantly increased. Decisions to act or not can be unconsciously manipulated, at least by inhibitory mechanisms. The cognitive mechanisms for intentionally withholding an action can be influenced by unconscious processing. We discuss possible moral and legal implications of these findings. Keywords Inhibition Intention Go/NoGo Priming Volition 1 Introduction The idea of voluntary control over what to do, and indeed whether to do it at all- is a fundamental but controversial feature of human nature. For example, legal judgements about criminal behaviour are based on the view that the agent could have refrained from the criminal act. Further, the feeling of choosing to act in certain ways while resisting others is a common experience in everyday life. We use the term ‘intentional inhibition’ to refer to the process of voluntarily withholding the execution of an action at the last moment. Inhibition of impending action triggered by external stimuli has been widely studied, notably in stop-signal tasks (Logan, Cowan, & Davis, 1984; Verbruggen & Logan, 2008). In such cases, inhibition can be clearly distinguished from an early decision not to prepare an action. We use the term inhibition to mean an intervention mechanism that “applies the brakes” and actively overrides impending movement (see Aron (2011) for a review of these mechanisms). Inhibition in this sense can result either from an external ‘stop’ signal, or from an internal decision. Internally-generated inhibition has been much less studied, although its importance in theories of cognitive control is recognised (Aron, 2011; Filevich, Kühn, & Haggard, 2012). Intentional inhibition has traditionally been linked with a conscious form of voluntary self-control. Libet, Gleason, Wright, and Pearl (1983) classically argued that the short delay between awareness of intention and movement onset was sufficient to allow a ‘conscious veto’ over action. On this view, people may not have free will, but they may have ‘free won’t’. Recent work in social psychology continues to emphasise the importance of conscious effort in refraining from apparently rewarding actions (Baumeister, Masicampo, & Vohs, 2011). In both instances, intentional inhibition seems like a paradigm case for a conscious form of “agent causation” (Kane, 1996a, 1996b). Importantly, however, it is quite possible that a capacity for internally-generated inhibition exists, yet its triggering could be unconscious. Here we ask whether intentional inhibition can be influenced by external stimuli that are not consciously perceived. It is widely accepted that endogenous ‘free’ actions may nevertheless be influenced by external stimuli, including subliminal stimuli that are not consciously perceived, but whose informational content is processed in the nervous system. For example, subliminal perceptual priming can manipulate the subjective experience of the agency of a “free” action (Aarts, Custers, & Wegner, 2005; Linser & Goschke, 2007; Sato, 2009; Sebanz & Lackner, 2007; Wenke, Fleming, & Haggard, 2010). Moreover, subliminal priming can also influence a “free” decision regarding which of a number of alternative actions one selects. However, some psychologists have argued that inhibition has a special relation to conscious awareness. Specifically, inhibition of action may be a necessarily conscious and effortful cognitive control process, and thus immune to unconscious information-processing (e.g., Dehaene et al., 2003). We cannot resist a prepotent action without consciously intending to resist it, and knowing that we are doing so. This view receives some support from anecdotal accounts of intense subjective experience of trying to overcome urges to prepotent action (St. Augustine, 2006). Overall this would suggest that intentional inhibition should not be manipulable by subliminal exogenous stimuli. Even if we do not really have ‘free will’, ‘free won’t’, in the sense of top-down inhibitory self-control, might remain a distinct cognitive process, relatively free from such unconscious environmental determinants. Subliminal stimuli can indeed influence inhibitory processing in externally-instructed forced-choice tasks. In many such studies, primes and targets are directional arrows indicating whether to make a left or right keypress. Targets preceded by congruent primes show decreased response times, and targets preceded by incongruent primes show increased response times, both relative to neutral primes (Neumann & Klotz, 1994). This positive compatibility effect (PCE) is thought to reflect facilitation of the primed response and/or inhibition of the alternative response. In contrast, in the negative compatibility effect (NCE; Eimer, 1999; Eimer & Schlaghecken, 1998) the congruent prime paradoxically inhibits responding. By increasing the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the onset of prime and target, the normal facilitatory effect of the congruent prime is reversed. Now a prime congruent with the target slows responses whilst the incongruent prime speeds responses. One prominent theory for the process driving the PCE and NCE effects hypothesises that subliminal primes exert their influence by motor preparation and then inhibition of relevant responses. Initially, a prime will exert a facilitatory influence upon the appropriate motor response, activating it to a sub-response-threshold level. If a congruent supraliminal target appears, the facilitatory activity caused by the prime coincides and combines with that of the target, resulting in a faster response. However, the sub-threshold activation caused by the prime is assumed to be transient. If no further congruent evidence arrives shortly after the prime, the prime-induced activation is followed by a process of auto-inhibition, suppressing the activity below baseline. This process is thought to protect perceptual systems from oversensitivity to noise (Blankenburg et al., 2003). Long prime-target SOAs mean that the target appears during the auto-inhibitory period, thus resulting in the slowed responses that characterise the NCE. The NCE has also been explained in other ways. In particular, the interaction between the prime and the subsequent mask has been argued to facilitate perception of the alternative target that is not primed, thus producing a negative compatibility effect (Lleras & Enns, 2004; Verleger, Jaśkowski, Aydemir, van der Lubbe, & Groen, 2004). This question, which remains controversial, is revisited in the discussion. Most previous subliminal priming studies focussed on decisions about what action to make, in two-alternative forced choice paradigms (Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2004). However, recent research has extended the method to decisions whether to act at all, by studying priming of inhibition in unimanual Go/No-Go tasks Hughes and colleagues used masked subliminal primes to influence responses in a Go/No-Go paradigm (Hughes, Velmans, & De Fockert, 2009). Participants were instructed to prepare a speeded response with a designated hand. They should respond rapidly following a Go stimulus, but inhibit execution of this action following a No-Go signal. Left and right arrow targets were preceded by left, right and neutral (double arrow) masked primes, at latencies appropriate for PCE. One arrow direction was designated as the Go and the other as the No-Go target. They found that Go targets preceded by a Go prime indeed elicited faster responses than Go targets preceded by a neutral prime, while a No-Go prime slowed responses to a Go target, again compared to neutral. Event-related potentials to No-Go targets revealed that fronto-central N2 and P3 components, previously associated with response inhibition (Falkenstein, Hoormann, & Hohnsbein, 1999), were modulated by the subliminal primes: No-Go primes reduced the magnitude of the negative N2 component (∼300ms after the target) elicited by No-Go targets, compared to effects of neutral and Go primes. This suggests that unconscious No-Go primes contributed to action inhibition. Thus, Hughes et al. (2009) argue that unconscious exogenous cues can indeed influence inhibitory control processes. In another Go/No-Go experiment (van Gaal, Ridderinkhof, Fahrenfort, Scholte, & Lamme, 2008), a Go signal (black ring) indicated that an action should be performed, unless it was preceded by the No-Go signal (grey circle). If the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between No-Go and Go signals was sufficient, the No-Go signal was consciously perceived. However, it could be rendered unconscious by reducing the SOA such that the Go signal masked its presence. These unconscious No-Go signals reduced the number of GO responses, and also slowed response times on those trials where a response did occur. In an fMRI experiment, the same unconscious No-Go signals elicited activity in frontal inhibitory areas, especially the IFC and pre-SMA (van Gaal, Ridderinkhof, Scholte, & Lamme, 2010). Finally, unconsciously presented Stop signals presented prior to a Go signal in the classic stop signal task (Logan, Cowan & Davids, 1984), reduced the number of executed responses, or slowed RTs on trials where responses did occur (van Gaal, Ridderinkhof, van den Wildenberg, & Lamme, 2009). These results suggest that inhibition elicited by an external signal can be unconsciously modulated by subliminal primes, just like action selection decisions between alternative responses. However, inhibiting one response is not the same choosing another (Aron, 2011; Simmonds, Pekar, & Mostofsky, 2008). Accordingly, inhibitory priming and action-selection priming appear to work in different ways. First, inhibitory priming recruits a specific set of frontal brain areas associated with stopping prepotent actions, distinct from the areas that accumulate evidence about alternatives (Van Gaal et al., 2010). Second, inhibitory priming has effects even when the decision to inhibit comes after an initial decision to act – as in the stop-signal task. This late inhibition of action implies a late braking or cancellation process. In contrast, priming of action selection is considered to bias early accumulation of evidence in favour of one response. It remains unclear whether intentional decisions to inhibit action can be unconsciously influenced in the same way. Indeed, no previous study has shown that free, internally-generated choices whether to execute or inhibit action can be unconsciously primed. The traditional association between inhibition and conscious, effortful control (Dehaene et al., 2003; Mayr, 2004; Vohs & Baumeister, 2013) might suggest that they cannot be. In the present study we directly tested this claim by investigating whether unconscious primes can, in fact, influence intentional inhibition in a situation where participants have the free choice to either execute a simple action, or to decide at the last possible moment to refrain from executing it. We used a modified Go/No-Go task in which participants were asked to prepare a single action (a keypress) and await the presentation of one of three target stimuli: One target indicated the participant must perform the action (forced Go), one indicated the inhibition of the action (forced No-Go), and the third target indicated participants had the free choice to either act or inhibit (free Go or No-Go). Targets were preceded by masked subliminal primes that were congruent with the Go or No-Go targets, or were neutral. Three experiments were run, using prime-target SOA values which were known to produce PCE and/or NCE priming effects. Thus we aimed to measure whether subliminal Go or No-Go primes modulate the execution or inhibition of responses that the participant freely chooses whether to make or not. Experiments 1 and 2 used left and right pointing targets and primes, Experiment 1 with PCE and Experiment 2 with NCE timings. Experiment 3 combined both types of priming and used upward and downward pointing arrows. Clear predictions could be made regarding the outcome of these results: Go primes at PCE latency would facilitate and thus speed up forced Go responses, whereas NoGo primes would inhibit, thus slow down, forced Go responses relative to Neutral primes. The opposite RT pattern was predicted for priming at NCE latencies (as per Eimer (1999)). We predicted that free-choice RTs should be influenced by primes in the same way was forced choices. If priming indeed alters levels of excitation/inhibition in brain motor circuits, it should also affect the outcome of ‘free’ choices. Go primes at PCE latency should increase the probability of choosing to act, and NoGo primes should increase the probability of choosing to inhibit. Primes at NCE latency should have the opposite effect. These predictions were used to guide analysis of the data. 2 Method 2.1 Design Three experiments were designed to measure the effects of subliminal priming on volitional action and inhibition in a Go/No-Go paradigm. Stimulus timing was designed to elicit PCE (Experiment 1), NCE priming (Experiment 2), or both within the same experiment (Experiment 3). The designs were otherwise largely similar. The basic paradigm involved participants making Go, No-Go or Free Choice responses to visual target stimuli using one hand only to make keypress responses. A trial consisted of a central fixation cross, followed by a visual subliminal priming sequence (see later) culminating in a supraliminal target stimulus. In Experiments 1 and 2, Target stimuli were either left, right, or double-headed (left and right) arrows. In Experiment 3, target stimuli were either up arrows, down arrows, or double-headed arrows. In all experiments, there were 25% Go targets, 25% NoGo targets and 50% Free Choice targets. Each target could be preceded by Go, NoGo or Neutral primes, with equal probability. In all experiments, participants were instructed that each trial would start with a fixation cross, and would be followed by some “random flashing shapes”. Participants were instructed to prepare a keypress action, on every trial, beginning their preparation from the onset of fixation. Each trial would culminate in a clearly visible arrow stimulus, that could point either left or right (Experiments 1 and 2), up or down (Experiment 3), or in both directions (all experiments). They were instructed that one of the uni-directional arrows was a Go signal, upon which they must make the prepared action as rapidly as possible. Speed of response times was stressed, again emphasising the need for action preparation from the beginning of every trial. This was further stressed as there was a one second response window from the onset of any target stimulus within which to make a response. The opposite uni-directional arrow was designated as the No-Go target, upon which participants were instructed to withhold the keypress action and wait until the next trial. Double-headed arrows indicated a Free Choice trial. Participants were instructed to make an in-the-moment decision regarding whether to press the key, or inhibit the keypress action on such trials. They were informed that it made no difference to the experimental outcome if they chose to act or not: the decision on each trial was arbitrary. They were encouraged to decide at the last moment, avoiding strategies like alternation of action and inhibition decisions. They were also asked to ensure that they sampled from both action and inhibition options throughout the experiment. This was not an explicit instruction to “equalise” act and inhibition choices, but just encouragement to not bias extremely to one choice or the other. The format of this instruction relates to a fundamental feature of experiments on volition. There is an inherent tension between allowing participants a truly free choice, and the experimental requirement to have adequate data relating to both possible responses. Exclusion criteria were defined to remove participants with outlying distribution of free choices, thus ensuring a sufficient number of each possible response for reliable estimation. Participants with a proportion of free-choice actions ±2.5 SD from sample mean were excluded (see Section 2.2 for details). There were important difference between experiments as to which uni-directional arrows were Go and No-Go targets, and which response hand to use. In Experiments 1 and 2, at the beginning of each of four experimental blocks, participants were informed which uni-directional arrow – left or right – was the Go target for the entirety of that block. Participants were instructed to use the hand congruent with the Go target to respond throughout the block. Handedness was counterbalanced across participants and blocks in an ABBA fashion. That is, Go targets and primes were arrows that were spatially compatible with the hand used as the Go response. NoGo primes and targets might, in principle, produce spatial incompatibility effects (Simon, 1969). To control for this possibility, Experiment 3 used up or down arrows at Go/NoGo targets, and right hand responses. In all three experiments, only right-handed participants were tested. The experiments used different forms of action-priming, produced by altering the stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) between prime and target stimuli (or between mask and target see Fig. 1 ). Short SOAs of 52ms were used to produce PCE priming (Experiment 1), whereas longer SOAs of 172ms were used for NCE priming (Experiment 2; Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005; see Section 2.4 for further details). Experiment 3 used both PCE and NCE priming in separate blocks of a within-subject design. Blocking of PCE and NCE was preferred to randomisation, because trial-by-trial changes in prime-target SOAs reportedly increase task difficulty (Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005). The frequency of action and inhibition, and the latency of all responses made were measured in Go, No-Go and Free Choice trials. Unbeknownst to the participants, each target stimulus was preceded by a backwards meta-contrast masked prime arrow, which could point either left, right, or be a superimposition of left and right arrows (up/down arrows in Experiment 3; see Fig. 1; stimulus design as used by (Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005). Thus primes could be either Go, No-Go or Neutral primes based upon their stimulus congruency. Therefore, Experiments 1 and 2 investigated the effects of prime-response congruency on target response, whilst Experiment 3 employed a 2 (latency effect: NCE vs PCE)×3 (prime) design. 2.2 Participants All participants were recruited from the UCL participant pool. All were self-reported right-handers, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were paid £7.50 for the hour-long total duration of the experiment. Twenty-two participants (9 female) took part in Experiment 1, mean age 26.3 (SD 5.29). Twenty-three participants took part in Experiment 2, but one was excluded based on prior criteria, because of an excessive tendency to prefer action in free-choice trials (91.1%, >2.5 standard deviations from sample mean), which rendered their data on inhibition choices insufficient and potentially unreliable. This left a sample of 22 (12 female, mean age 26.9, SD 8.76). Twenty-three participants took part in Experiment 3. Again, one was rejected for making so few freely-chosen actions in Choice trials (1.3%, <2.5 standard deviations from sample mean) that their data could not be meaningfully analysed, leaving a sample of 22 (14 female, mean age 22.4, SD 3.46). 2.3 Procedure All experiments used an identical procedure in terms of participant briefing and experimental structure. Experiments 1 and 2 consisted of 384 trials, split over four blocks, each block varying the response hand and Go-Arrow direction, as described in Section 2.1. Experiment 3 consisted of 768 trials over 8 blocks, each block consisting exclusively of PCE or NCE trials, with alternating blocks. For both the forced Go and No-Go target conditions, 32 trials were presented for each of the three primes (and for each of the PCE/NCE Latencies in Experiment 3). For the free Choice trials, 64 trials were presented for each of the three primes. Thus, if subjects chose to act or withhold action on similar numbers of trials, the dataset would sample across free and forced action and inhibition in a balanced way. Between each block, participants were allowed a short self-terminated break. Prior to the main experiment, participants undertook a practice session consisting of two blocks, one for each hand (in Experiment 3, two blocks, one for each of the PCE and NCE conditions). Practice trials only used the neutral prime, and involved 6 trials each of the Free Choice and Forced conditions, thus each practice block contained 18 trials. After the main experimental session was complete, participants were informed of the presence of the subliminal primes, and were then asked to take part in a short final session to collect data on the discriminability of the primes. One block of trials presented participants with stimulus sequences similar to those in the main experiments, except that only free choice targets were presented. Participants were instructed to ignore the targets. Instead they were asked to concentrate carefully in the period where the prime appeared – often detectable as a “small white flash” – and try and decide whether the prime was a left, right, or neutral prime, and make un-speeded but forced choices. They were instructed to guess if uncertain. Thus 10 repetitions of each of the three prime stimuli were presented. The entire experiment lasted around 1h. 2.4 Stimuli Stimuli were presented on a PC using the Psychophysics Toolbox version 3 for Matlab (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007; Pelli, 1997), on a CRT monitor with a 75Hz refresh rate, using a white-on-black colour scheme. Participants were seated at a comfortable viewing distance and used a customised button box to make responses. Stimulus dimensions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, and were based on those used by Lingnau and Vorberg (2005). At the start of each trial the central fixation cross, subtending 0.2°, was shown for a period of 534ms (Experiment 1) or 414ms (NCE experiment), maintaining an overall trial duration of 1586ms (including response window; 706ms from onset of fixation to offset of target) across both experiments, and building on timings established previously (Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005). Each prime stimulus was presented for 13ms (1 frame at 75Hz refresh rate), followed by a reintroduction of the fixation cross for 39ms. Following this the meta-contrast mask appeared for 120ms, a stimulus sequence found to make the discrimination of the prime stimulus not possible (Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005). Prime-Target SOA interval is the critical factor in determining the direction of priming: Experiment 1 used PCE priming with a prime-target SOA of 52ms (Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005), which meant that the target arrow onset at the same time as the mask and thus surrounded the mask (see Fig. 1, top), also lasting for 120ms. Experiment 2 used NCE priming with a prime-target SOA of 172ms, which meant the target arrow onset immediately after the offset of the mask, and remained onscreen for a further 120ms. 3 Results 3.1 Prime discrimination results Discrimination test results were measured by computing the mean percentage of trials correctly discriminated, and comparing this against the chance-level of 33% correct using single sample t-tests. Participants in Experiment 1 (using PCE timings) could not consciously discriminate primes, mean correct 35.2%, SD 9.83. A t-test was used to compare this to the chance level of 33.3%: t(21)=0.847, p =.406. Nor could they do so in Experiment 2 (NCE timings), M 31.5%, SD 13.2; t(21)=0.633, p =.534. In Experiment 3, mean correct discriminability score was 33.9%, SD 6.73, and again not significantly different from chance, t(21)=0.412, p =.684. We also computed d′ measures of discrimination for each prime in each experiment, and used repeated uncorrected t-tests to compare these to a value of 0 (no discrimination possible). The maximum d′ was 0.21, and no t-test was significant, further suggesting that no conscious discrimination of the primes was possible (full values of d′ and t-test results are shown in Supplementary Table 1). 3.2 Response times Correct response times were classified as either “forced Go trials” (responses to Go signals), or-free choice Go trials (when participants chose to press the button in free choice trials). Response times were further classified according to the prime (Go/No-Go/Neutral) preceding the target stimulus, thus producing a 2×3 repeated measures ANOVA design (2×2×3 for Experiment 3, where PCE/NCE Latency was also varied). Median response time in ms was taken for each participant for each condition. 3.2.1 Experiment 1 (PCE) Fig. 2 shows the summary of response times for Experiment 1. There were significant main effects of trial type, F(1,21)=9.45, p <.006, and of prime type, F(2,42)=18.0, p <.001, but no significant interaction, F(2,42)=1.39, p =.261. Planned contrasts were performed for each trial type, because we had a specific prior interest in whether primes would significantly influence free choice responses. In forced Go trials, response times were faster for Go prime trials compared to Neutral primes, t(21)=3.15, p =.002, and slower for No-Go primes compared to Neutral primes, t(21)=3.08, p =.003. In free choice Go trials, response times were slower for No-Go primes compared to Neutral primes, t(21)=5.75 p <.001, but there was no difference in response times between Go and Neutral prime trials, t(21)=0.47, p =.322. On average, over all prime types, free choice Go responses were 37ms slower than forced Go responses. (Full F, t, and response time differences are in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). 3.2.2 Experiment 2 (NCE) Fig. 3 shows the summary of response times for Experiment 2. There were significant main effects of trial type, F(1,21)=44.6, p <.001, and of prime type, F(2,42)=31.1, p <.001, but no interaction, F(2,42)=0.772, p =.466. Planned contrasts were performed because of our prior interest in the effects of priming in free choice trials. In forced Go trials, response times were slower for Go prime trials compared to Neutral primes, t(21)=5.21, p <.001, and slower for No-Go primes compared to Neutral primes, t(21)=1.98, p =.031. In free choice Go trials, response times were slower for Go primes compared to Neutral primes, t(21)=3.82, p =.001, and there was a trend for No-Go primes to speed responses compared to Neutral primes, t(21)=1.56, p =.067. On average, over all prime types, free choice Go responses were 42ms slower than forced Go responses. (Full F, t, and response time differences are in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). 3.2.3 Experiment 3 First, response times (excluding No-Go trials) in Experiment 3 were analysed in a 2 (Latency Effect, PCE/NCE)×2 (Trial Type)×3 (Prime type) repeated measures ANOVA (see Supplementary Table 2 for full results). There were significant main effects of Latency Effect, F(1,21)=7.24, p =.014, and Prime, F(2,42)=4.48, p =.029, but no main effect of Trial Type F(1,21)=1.62, p =.217. The only significant interaction was between Prime and Latency Effect, F(2,42)=21.6, p <.001, supporting the fact that the PCE and NCE paradigms reverse the response time effects of priming magnitude (as seen comparing Experiments 1 and 2). There was no three way interaction with trial type, F(2,42)=1.87, p =.177. As for Experiments 1 and 2, we performed planned contrasts because of our prior interest in priming effects on Free Choice trials. We therefore split trials by choice Type (Forced Go and Free Choice Go) and compared results across Latency Effect (PCE vs NCE). Fig. 4 shows response times for Forced Go trials. There was a main effect of Prime, F(2,42)=3.44, p =.041, but none of Latency Effect, F(1,21)=1.64, p =.241. There was a significant interaction between the two factors, F(2,42)=27.8, p <.001, due to the expected opposite effects of PCE and NCE. Using simple effects testing to investigate this interaction, Go primes at PCE latency produced faster responses compared than Neutral primes, t(21)=2.74, p =.006, and No-Go primes produced slower response times, t(21)=3.75, p .001. At NCE latency Go primes produced slower responses than Neutral primes, t(21)=5.77, p <.001, but there was no significant difference between No-Go and Neutral primes, t(21)=0.52, p =.305. (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 show full F, t and response time difference values). Fig. 5 shows response times for Free Choice trials in which actions were made. These data were analysed using the same planned contrasts as forced-choice latencies. There was a main effect of Latency Effect, F(1,21)=10.7, p =.004, no main effect of Prime, F(2,42)=2.31, p =.134, and a strong interaction between the two, F(2,42)=8.90, p =.002. Simple effects showed that Go primes at PCE latency did not produce faster response compared to Neutral prime, t(21)=0.277, p =.392, but No-Go primes did slow responses, t(21)=6.55, p <.001. Go primes at NCE latency did not significantly slow response times, t(21)=0.848, p =.203, nor did No-Go primes facilitate them t(21)=1.10, p =.143. 3.3 Forced response behavioural errors In forced choice trials, errors were few. In Experiment 1, in forced Go trials, mean error-of-omission rate was 4.17% (SD 7.3), whilst in No-Go trials mean error-of-commission rate was 5.2% (SD 4.74). In Experiment 2, in forced Go trials, mean error-of-omission rate was 0.99% (SD 1.07), whilst in No-Go trials mean error-of-commission rate was 2.4% (SD 2.45). In Experiment 3, in the PCE condition, Go trials produced 4.1% (SD 7.8) and No-Go trials 7.2% (SD 7.3) errors. In the NCE conditions, Go trials produced 3.8% (SD 7.6) and No-Go 6.6% (SD 7.7) errors. Errors were not further analysed. 3.4 Free choice behaviour 3.4.1 Experiments 1 & 2 The response rates for Free Choice trials were analysed to investigate how subliminal priming influenced participants’ choices to execute or inhibit actions. In The proportion of actions in Free Choice trials was 58.8% (SD 18.3), 56.5% (SD 14.1), and 50.3% (SD 3.46) for Experiments 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Experiments 1 and 2. Fig. 6 shows the rate at which participants chose to act in free choice trials as a function of the preceding subliminal prime, in both the PCE and NCE experiments. A 3×2 mixed ANOVA using Latency effect (PCE/NCE) and Prime type showed no significant main effect of Latency F(1,42)=0.719, p =.401, or Prime type was found, F(2,84)=0.372, p =.690, but a highly significant interaction between the two factors F(2,84)=7.08, p =.001. Simple effects within each experiment was used to explore this interaction. In Experiment 1 (PCE priming), there was no significant main effect of priming on behavioural choice, F(1.55,32.6)=1.7, p =.198, Greenhouse–Geisser corrected for sphericity. However, in Experiment 2 (NCE priming) prime type significantly influenced behavioural choice, F(1.53,32.1)=6.93, p =.006, Greenhouse–Geisser corrected for sphericity. Follow-up testing showed that Go primes produced a significant 4% reduction in the proportion of free-choice actions relative to Neutral, t(21)=1.87, p =.038. Conversely, a No-Go prime increased response rate by 3.8%, t(21)=2.56, p =.009. Note that these differences are in the predicted direction for inhibitory effects of NCE priming. Overall, this pattern of results suggests that the volitional free choice to act or inhibit can be non-consciously influenced by NCE priming, but the effect of PCE priming is less clear (full F, t and response difference values in Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). 3.4.2 Experiment 3 Response rates to Free Choice trials in Experiment 3 are shown in Fig. 7 and were analysed using a 3×2 repeated measures ANOVA using Latency Effect and Prime as factors. There were no main effects of Latency Effect, P(1,21)=0.423, p =.518, or Prime, F(2,42)=1.88, p =.166, but a significant interaction between the two, F(2,42)=3.85, p =.029. Simple effects testing to explore this interaction showed that prime type had no significant effect at PCE latencies, F(2,42)=0.59, p =.559, but had a significant effect at NCE latencies F(2,42)=6.25, p =.004. Follow-up testing of the NCE data showed that Go primes produced a trend to fewer actions than neutral primes t(21)=1.58, p =.065, while No-Go primes significantly increased the proportion of actions t(21)=2.39, p =.013. Comparing the proportions for Go and No-Go primes directly showed that priming caused a significant 6.7% swing in ‘free’ choices t(21)=2.99, p =003. 3.5 Supplementary analyses We performed two supplementary analyses to investigate specific concerns with our experimental design. Experiments 1 and 2 used left/right arrows. Effects of primes on motor inhibition are thus potentially confounded with spatial compatibility effects (Simon, 1969). Experiment 3 used up/down arrows, and so should avoid this confound. We therefore compared the effects of priming between Experiment 1 and the PCE data from Experiment 3, and between Experiment 2 and the NCE data from Experiment 3, using separate mixed model ANOVAs on the proportion of free-choice actions. If priming of motor inhibition strongly depends on spatial compatibility effects, these ANOVAs should reveal significant main effects of prime orientation. For PCE priming results, there was no significant main effects of either Prime or orientation, nor was there a significant interaction (all p >.074). For NCE priming results, there was a strong main effect of Prime type, F(2,84)=13.1, p <.001, but no significant main effect of orientation and no interaction(both p >.349). This suggests that NCE priming effects are not merely spatial compatibility effects (e.g., Simon, 1969). In a further analysis, we investigated whether the effects of primes on free-choice responses could involve a form of speed-accuracy trade-off. In particular, since, our design encouraged advance preparation of action. Therefore, a focus on speed might be expected to produce both rapid response times and few choices to inhibit, while a more conservative information-processing strategy might produce both slower response times and more choices to inhibit. In that case, the effect of each prime type on a participant’s response times should be strongly related to the effect of the same prime on the proportion of free-choice actions. To investigate this possibility, we correlated the effects of Go primes on each participant’s free choice response times and action choices. A similar correlation was performed for NoGo primes. Neither correlation was significant (all p >.1). Full F, t and difference values can be found in Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). 4 Discussion These experiments provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that unconscious priming can influence the ‘free’ decision to act or inhibit. We used a modified Go/No-Go paradigm in which Go, No-Go or Free Choice targets were preceded by masked primes. The primes were congruent with Go targets, No-Go targets, or were neutral. By varying the SOA between primes and targets, we were able to use the same prime stimulus to either facilitate or inhibit the response to the target. Subliminal primes were shown to influence both response times and action choices, in both forced and free choice conditions. In particular, our subliminal primes were able to influence the intentional decision to withhold action on free-choice trials. A Go prime at NCE latency increased the proportion of choices to inhibit on free-choice trials, while No-Go primes increased the proportion of choices to act. This effect was consistent with previous NCE effects on forced choice reaction time, and with our own data. Briefly, the target-congruent prime acts to slow responses to the target, by a process of auto-inhibition of the target-related response (Eimer, 1999; Schlaghecken, Rowley, Sembi, Simmons, & Whitcomb, 2007), whilst target-incongruent primes speed this response. NCE effects are often explained in terms of auto-inhibitory processes induced by primes (Eimer & Schlaghecken, 1998). We show that these processes may also influence the ‘free’ decision to act or not. Intentional decisions to withhold action might arise for the same reason as auto-inhibition in NCE priming. That is, if internal action decisions are not subsequently confirmed and reinforced, the corresponding motor activation may then be suppressed. This process of auto-inhibition may partly explain why volitional decisions often appear weak and changeable (Fleming, Mars, Gladwin, & Haggard, 2009). Some authors argue that the NCE is due not to motor inhibition, but to interactions between prime and mask, leading to a perceptual after-effect. This effectively primes the opposite direction arrow from that shown as a prime (Lleras & Enns, 2004; Verleger et al., 2004). Our results cannot address this controversy directly. However, a significant body of experimental research (Boy, Husain, Singh, & Sumner, 2010; Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2006) has been presented in favour of the auto-inhibition account. Our core finding, that free decisions to inhibit can be unconsciously biased, stands independently of precise details of the mechanisms of NCE priming. We found that PCE priming had no significant effect on free choice to act or inhibit. However, PCE priming did significantly modulate response times as expected, with Go primes speeding and No-Go primes slowing responses. That is, NCE priming influenced response choices, while PCE priming influenced response latencies. This interesting pattern of association was not predicted, and requires further research. Very speculatively, action choices may involve management of noise levels within action decision systems, and therefore be subject to NCEs. In contrast, PCEs may reflect excitability of post-decisional motor execution pathways, for example as measured by lateralised readiness potentials (Eimer & Schlaghecken, 1998). In previous research (Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2004), free choices of which of two action alternatives to perform were sensitive to both PCE and NCE priming effects. Our current results suggest that, when free choice concerns not which action to select, but instead concerns the later decision of whether to execute or inhibit the prepared action at the last moment (Brass & Haggard, 2008), facilitatory PCE priming effects are weaker than inhibitory NCE priming effects. This may reflect the importance of late-stage inhibition for free choices to act or not act. Finally, Experiment 3, used up and down instead of left and right arrows as primes and targets, and compared PCE and NCE latencies in the same participants. Since the stimulus and response dimensions in Experiment 3 were orthogonal, these results exclude any spatial-compatibility explanations that could potentially be applied to Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e., compatibility between response hand and arrow direction producing a “Simon Effect”, Simon, 1969). In Experiment 3 we again demonstrated unconscious priming effects on intentional inhibition, this time when automatic spatial stimulus–response mappings are eliminated. Moreover, comparisons between experiments showed that stimulus orientation did not significantly influence the size of priming effects Thus, priming of intentional inhibition is not simply a reflection of ‘Simon inhibition’ and spatial incompatibility costs. Experiment 3 also replicated using a within-subjects design, the different effects of PCE and NCE priming on response times and free choices to act or inhibit. These results suggest that relatively late, volitional, high-level cognitive control processes can be manipulated by non-conscious means, contrary to previous supposition (Dehaene et al., 2003). Previous studies showed how non-conscious factors can influence volitional decisions, and indeed entire behavioural patterns. For example, “social priming” effects suggest that behaviour can be unconsciously cued by social stereotypes (Bargh, Chen, & Burrows, 1996). However, Doyen, Klein, Pichon, and Cleeremans (2012) could not replicate this result. Further, our paradigm has some experimental advantages over “social priming” methods: First, we explicitly demonstrated the subliminal nature of the priming stimuli. Second, we demonstrated bipolar directionality of the priming effects (that is, we show facilitatory and inhibitory primes in both PCE and NCE cases). Finally, we have been able to use a within-subjects design, which is not generally possible in social priming settings. Low-level influences on high-level cognition have been widely studied. For example, voluntary task-choice can be affected by bottom-up influences such as task-difficulty or repetition of task-set (Lien & Ruthruff, 2008; Poljac & Yeung, 2012; Yeung, 2010). However, these studies appear to involve an earlier processing stage than intentional inhibition (Brass & Haggard, 2008). The psychological interest of our study arises from the combination of bottom-up influence, and the traditional association between consciousness, self-control, and the final inhibitory “veto” over one’s own actions. Influential theories distinguish fully-conscious late-stage processes from early non-conscious representation (Dehaene et al., 2003). In contrast, our result suggests that the late-stage processes of action inhibition may also be subject to unconscious environmental influences. Our experiment unconsciously manipulated a late-stage control process hile the individual remained unaware of the manipulation. Our participants’ decisions to act or inhibit were presumably conscious, though we did not explicitly test for this, and indeed there is no established method for doing so. However, we can be confident that their (conscious) decisions depended on unconscious influences from the external environment. Our results suggest, then, that inhibition of voluntary action is not only high-level and deliberate. Previous cognitive models viewed decisions to inhibit as interruption of routine schematised behaviour in novel situations, for example in the supervisory attentional system (Norman & Shallice, 1986; Shallice & Burgess, 1996). In the current paradigm, our subliminal prime manipulations may just bias ongoing fluctuating activation levels of different action alternatives (Leuthold & Kopp, 1998), and act as an additional driver of internal noise in action decision circuits. Such effects could therefore potentially be explained by a diffusion model (Schurger, Pereira, Treisman, & Cohen, 2009), combined with competitive inhibition between alternatives. Our results do not exclude hierarchical cognitive control of decisions to inhibit, but show that low-level influences also contribute. We observed priming of free decisions to inhibit in the very constrained setting of a laboratory experimental paradigm. Subliminal priming effects are known to be paradigm-specific, and do not generalise to everyday behavioural control. Therefore, it remains unclear if the mechanisms we have demonstrated are important in the real world. However, our results have potentially interesting implications for self-control. The capacity to inhibit the impulse to act is of extreme legal importance. Our findings suggest that this capacity can be unconsciously influenced by external factors, at least under the restricted circumstances of our experiments. Since individuals are not aware of these factors, perhaps they cannot reasonably control them, and thus cannot be responsible for their own failures to inhibit? Our study also has a more positive implication: inhibitory capacity can be increased by unconscious influences. This raises the interesting possibility of training self-control using the techniques of implicit learning.

Highlights • In theory, the motor system attenuates action-outcome perception to signal agency. • We use subliminal motor priming to test for the predicted motor locus of this effect. • The perceived intensity of an action-outcome is attenuated by compatible priming. • Compatible priming is known to enhance explicit agency judgements. • Sensory attenuation and agency inference depend on overlapping motoric signals. Abstract The sense of control over the consequences of one’s actions depends on predictions about these consequences. According to an influential computational model, consistency between predicted and observed action consequences attenuates perceived stimulus intensity, which might provide a marker of agentic control. An important assumption of this model is that these predictions are generated within the motor system. However, previous studies of sensory attenuation have typically confounded motor-specific perceptual modulation with perceptual effects of stimulus predictability that are not specific to motor action. As a result, these studies cannot unambiguously attribute sensory attenuation to a motor locus. We present a psychophysical experiment on auditory attenuation that avoids this pitfall. Subliminal masked priming of motor actions with compatible prime–target pairs has previously been shown to modulate both reaction times and the explicit feeling of control over action consequences. Here, we demonstrate reduced perceived loudness of tones caused by compatibly primed actions. Importantly, this modulation results from a manipulation of motor processing and is not confounded by stimulus predictability. We discuss our results with respect to theoretical models of the mechanisms underlying sensory attenuation and subliminal motor priming. Abbreviations NCE negative compatibility effect PCE positive compatibility effect Keywords Sensory attenuation Sense of agency Motor predictions Subliminal motor priming Negative compatibility effect 1 Introduction “Sense of agency” refers to the pre-reflective feeling of controlling one’s actions and, through them, sensory events in the outside world (Haggard & Chambon, 2012). Sense of agency is a fundamental aspect of human action control, as illustrated by the profound changes when actual control and subjective experience of agency are decoupled, as in schizophrenia (Voss et al., 2010) or in patients with alien motor phenomena (Spence, 2002). According to an influential theoretical account of the sense of agency, agency is inferred by comparing predictions made during action processing with perception (e.g. Shergill, Samson, Bays, Frith, & Wolpert, 2005; but see Synofzik, Vosgerau, & Newen 2008). Based on computational theories of motor control (Wolpert & Miall, 1996), such comparator models assert that a sense of agency over an external event will occur when the sensory information about the event is a predicted consequence of the action. According to the model, predictions of action consequences are used to cancel or partly cancel sensory feedback signals at a comparator node. This cancellation or attenuation process reduces perceived stimulus intensity of only those external events that are caused by one’s own actions (e.g. Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith, 1998; but see Brown, Adams, Parees, Edwards, & Friston, 2013). When a sensory event is not predicted by current action processing, there is said to be a ‘mismatch’ between prediction and sensory consequence, and the sensory event is not attenuated. Such a mismatch may signal non-agency (Farrer et al., 2008). While the comparator model cannot account for all aspects of the sense of agency (Haggard & Chambon, 2012; Synofzik et al., 2008), it provides physiologically plausible and testable predictions of how an integration of motor and sensory processing may contribute to the sense of agency. Sensory attenuation of action consequences is perhaps the most distinctive prediction of this model, and, accordingly, has received considerable attention in the literature (e.g. Bays, Wolpert, & Flanagan, 2005; Cardoso-Leite, Mamassian, Schütz-Bosbach, & Waszak, 2010). The model also makes the specific prediction that sensory predictions originate from a motor locus, within the circuits that generate motor actions. For example, sensory predictions of action consequences were linked to preparatory motor processing in theoretical work by Wolpert and Flanagan (2001) and by Wolpert and Ghahramani (2000). Because these predictions are generated by an internal forward model within the motor system, they are thought to be physiologically distinct from purely associative sensory predictions as induced, for example, by pairing of external, sensory events. Previous studies have not provided truly convincing evidence for this motor-specificity of sensory attenuation, in our view, although many have claimed to do so. Sensory attenuation effects have been demonstrated for self-applied tactile (e.g. Bays et al., 2005; Blakemore, Frith, & Wolpert, 1999), auditory and visual stimulation (Cardoso-Leite et al., 2010; Weiss, Herwig, & Schütz-Bosbach, 2011). However, these previous studies cannot unambiguously attribute these perceptual phenomena to motor processing. To do this, the physical parameters of the relation between action and consequent stimulus should be identical in the agency and non-agency condition. In particular, any differences between conditions in the contingency between action and stimulus easily would lead to stimulus identity or timing being more predictable in one condition than another. Any such difference in predictability would open the door to non-specific explanations of sensory attenuation phenomena, undermining a motor-specific account. For example, most previous studies on sensory attenuation have manipulated the sense of agency by comparing conditions which differed regarding (a) the presence of a motor response before the stimulus (e.g. Weiss et al., 2011), (b) its temporal relation to the stimulus (e.g. Bäss, Jacobsen, & Schröger, 2008), or (c) the mapping between different actions and consequent stimuli (e.g. Cardoso-Leite et al., 2010). In many cases, these manipulations of the relation between action and a subsequent sensory event clearly change stimulus predictability. In addition, some contrasts introduce other, potentially more dramatic differences between conditions, such as whether a motor task is present or not or whether contingencies have been learnt. Due to these potential confounds, any sensory attenuation in such studies could reflect purely associative sensory predictions that are not specific to motor action in addition to, or instead of, predictive signals generated within the motor system (for a review, see Hughes, Desantis, & Waszak, 2013). A recent series of studies has shown that an experimental manipulation of action processing, rather than the physical parameters of the action-stimulus sequence, can influence measures of experienced control over stimuli (Chambon & Haggard, 2012; Wenke, Fleming, & Haggard, 2010). Critically, these studies manipulated experienced agency not by omitting an action or changing the relation between an action and a consequent stimulus, but by inserting masked primes prior to the action. Wenke et al. (2010) and Chambon and Haggard 2012 demonstrated that self-reports of control over a visual stimulus that is contingent on an action decreases when subliminal primes and targets are incompatible when compared to trials with compatible prime–target pairs. These studies remove many of the potential confounds mentioned above. In particular, an action is always present, and its physical relation with the consequent event is held constant. Therefore, non-specific explanations based on stimulus predictability cannot readily explain the result. However, both of these studies focused on explicit agency judgements, i.e., self-reports of experienced causal control over a stimulus. In contrast, sensory attenuation is a pre-reflective and implicit measure, which may provide more direct insight into sense of agency (Synofzik et al., 2008). Here, we combined subliminal masked priming of motor actions with a psychophysical measure of sensory attenuation. Our motivation for this study was threefold: Firstly, we wanted to develop a theoretically pure, well-controlled test of sensory attenuation that avoided confounding effects of stimulus predictability. Secondly, we wanted to test the theoretical prediction that sensory attenuation arises specifically from motor processing. And thirdly, we wanted to test whether differences in action processing can lead to differences in sensory attenuation, even when the objective contingency of a stimulus on the preceding action is held constant. Such results would provide more convincing evidence for sensory attenuation as a motor-specific aspect of sense of agency. Prime–target compatibility in subliminal priming tasks can have either facilitatory or inhibitory effects on reaction times and error rates, depending on the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of primes and targets (Eimer, 1999; Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2000). At longer SOAs, facilitatory effects of compatible primes (positive compatibility effects, PCE) turn into inhibitory effects (negative compatibility effects, NCE). Chambon and Haggard (2012) reported similar effects of prime–target compatibility on control ratings for both PCE and NCE conditions, i.e., the experience of control was diminished by incompatible primes irrespective of the prime–target SOA. In particular, primes at NCE latency had a positive, enhancing effect on the sense of control over action outcomes, despite having a negative, detrimental effect on reaction times. This result suggests that sense of agency may depend on how the prime biases the initial process of action selection, and not on how the prime influences actual subsequent execution. Here, we focus on priming conditions known to induce negative compatibility effects on motor performance. This choice was motivated by the strong overlap between the neural mechanisms underlying the negative compatibility effect and those underlying sensory attenuation. Both effects have been linked to the supplementary motor area by correlational and causal evidence (Boy, Husain, Singh, & Sumner, 2010; Boy, Evans, et al., 2010; Haggard & Whitford, 2004; Sumner et al., 2007; Voss, Ingram, Wolpert, & Haggard, 2008). Positive compatibility effects on motor performance, on the other hand, have been shown to involve more widespread cortical networks, including more lateral motor and attentional areas (D’Ostilio and Garraux, 2012; Dehaene et al., 1998). Thus, the NCE may provide a more selective influence on those cortical circuits previously related to sensory attenuation. In line with Chambon & Haggard’s (2012) findings of an enhanced experience of control, we expected stronger sense of agency, and therefore more sensory attenuation, when primes and targets were compatible, compared to when they were incompatible. Note that the positive effect of primes on sense of agency would thus coexist with a negative effect on motor performance and on perceived intensity. 2 Methods 2.1 Participants We recruited sixteen healthy volunteers (age 22.8±3.2years (mean±SD), eight females). All participants were recruited via an online database. They gave written informed consent prior to participation with the right to exit the study at any time. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (University College London, UK). Participants received £10 per hour as reimbursement. 2.2 Task All stimuli were generated and the paradigm was programmed using Presentation® software (Neurobehavioral Systems, www.neurobs.com). The experiment was run in a dark and sound-attenuated room. The task was presented on an LCD screen at a vertical refresh rate of 60Hz. The screen background colour was white. Participants were seated 75cm in front of the screen and kept their chin on a chin rest throughout the experiment. The experiment consisted of a training session, a pre-test, the experimental task and a control task, in this order. In the experimental task, participants performed a temporal two-alternative forced choice task on the loudness of sine wave tones whose onset timing and frequency were determined by participants’ button presses. These button presses were subliminally primed. The training session served to familiarise participants with contingencies between their button presses and the onset timing and frequency of subsequent sine wave tones. In the pre-test, individual loudness discrimination thresholds were determined by means of an adaptive procedure and then used as constant stimulus levels in the experimental task. The control task tested conscious recognition of the primes. 2.2.1 Action priming Action priming was implemented as follows. Throughout all parts of the experiment, i.e. the training session, the pre-test, the experimental task and the control task, visual targets (black arrow outlines pointing to the right or to the left) were first preceded by visual primes and then by a metacontrast mask. Primes consisted of black arrows pointing either in the same direction as targets or in the opposite direction. In the training session and pre-test, superimposed arrows pointing in both directions served as neutral primes. The metacontrast mask was a black rectangle framing two white superimposed arrows that were pointing in both directions. All visual stimuli were presented at fixation. Primes subtended a visual angle of 2.84°∗1.18° and were presented for one frame (17ms). Primes were replaced by the fixation cross (font size 1°) for two frames (33ms), which in turn was followed by the metacontrast mask for seven frames (117ms), subtending a visual angle of 3.18°∗1.66°. After an SOA of nine frames (150ms), the target was presented. Targets subtended a visual angle of 5.3°∗1.95° and were presented for seven frames (117ms). The experimental factor was the compatibility between prime direction and target direction. 2.2.2 Training session In the training session (32 trials), participants learnt the contingency between their left or right index finger button presses, as instructed by the direction of the visual targets, and the presentation of a sine wave tone of one of two frequencies (900Hz and 750Hz; 100ms duration) via headphones. In this training session, participants performed two tasks in parallel. On each trial, they pressed a button either with their right or left index finger in response to the direction of the visual target. They were instructed to perform these button presses within one second after target onset and as quickly and accurately as possible. When pressing the wrong button (the button operated by the index finger opposite to the direction of the target) or when pressing the button too late (later than 1200s after target onset) a red “x” was presented at fixation (font size 1°). As in the pre-test and in the experimental task, these trials were repeated at the end of the regular 32 trials. Index finger button presses were followed by one of two sine wave tones after 50ms. For half of the participants, left index finger button presses led to the presentation of the low-frequency tone and right index finger button presses to the presentation of the high-frequency tone in the majority of trials of this training session, while the opposite mapping was used for the other half of participants. In the remaining three to five trials of the training session the reverse button – tone frequency mapping was valid (catch trials). The number and distribution of catch trials was randomly determined for each participant. Participants had to count these catch trials and report their number at the end of the training session. This task of counting catch trials was introduced to ensure that participants attended to the button – tone frequency contingencies. Only very few participants miscounted the number of catch trials. All of these were allowed to continue without repeating the training session after ensuring that they gave a correct account of the button – tone frequency mapping. 2.2.3 Pre-test In the pre-test (six blocks, 32 trials each) index finger button presses in response to the visual targets led to the presentation of a pair of tones of identical frequency, which was now fully determined by the (instructed) choice of buttons. The button – tone frequency mapping that was predominant in the training session was now valid on every single trial, so that participants did not encounter any further reversals of the mapping (no catch trials). The second tone followed the first after a fixed SOA of 1100ms to keep predictability of the onset timing of the two tones identical. Within each tone pair, one of the two was louder than the other. After the second tone, a question mark was presented in the centre of the screen, prompting participants to indicate whether the first or second tone was the louder by pressing one of two additional buttons with the middle finger of the right hand (these additional buttons were arranged orthogonal to the index finger buttons in order to minimise bias in middle finger button choice by the preceding index finger button press). There was no time limit for the loudness discrimination task. Participants received feedback for this loudness discrimination task after each trial (correct responses were indicated by a green tick, incorrect responses by a red “x”, both at fixation, font size 1°) and after each block (as the average percentage of correct responses in the previous block). In both the training session and the pre-test, only neutral primes (superimposed arrows pointing in both directions) were used. In this pre-test, stimulus levels were continuously adjusted using a weighted up/down staircase method (3 up, 1 down) (Kaernbach, 1991). There were four different staircases, as sample tones that were either louder or softer than the standard tone (74dB SPL) were used in separate staircases for each of the two tone frequencies. Initial step size was 6dB SPL (labelled “deltafirststep” below). Target direction, order of standard and sample tones and order of the four staircases were pseudo-randomly distributed across each block so that none of these were predictable from any of the others on a given trial. The downward step size was increased during the first two downward slopes of each staircase (3 up, 3 down) under the assumption that initial differences in loudness (corresponding to volume differences of ±6dB) were easily detectable. The corresponding first reversal points of the staircase were excluded from analysis. Sound volume was calibrated to dB SPL using a sound pressure level meter to arrive at a volume of the standard tone of 74dB SPL. During the pre-test, loudness of the sample tones was adapted exponentially, approaching 74dB SPL asymptotically from above and below with improving performance: At any point of the staircase, sound volume of the sample tone was determined by (74dB SPL±deltafirststep ∗1.15exponent), with the “±” determining whether the sample was louder or softer than the standard. Exponents started at zero and were varied by the 3 up, 1 down-manipulation (3 up, 3 down for the first two downward slopes), i.e., the exponent of the current staircase was decreased by 1 after a correct response and increased by 3 after an incorrect response. Calibration to dB SPL was checked on each testing day. Playback latency of the sound card was determined to be below 1ms in preliminary testing. After the pre-test, the discrimination threshold was determined as the average of all reversals (from decreasing to increasing volume differences and vice versa) from the third reversal onwards, for each of the four staircases separately. Results from this staircase procedure, i.e. threshold values and the number of reversals on which they were based, are reported in Section 3. 2.2.4 Experimental task The experimental task (Fig. 1 ) was identical to the pre-test except for four differences. First, there was no trial feedback for the loudness discrimination task (only the blockwise feedback, i.e., the average percentage of correct trials). Second, and unbeknown to participants, only the second tone was varied in loudness (softer or louder than the first), while the first tone was kept constant at 74dB SPL. Third, the experimental task was based on the method of constant stimuli, using individual discrimination threshold values from the pre-test for each of the two tone frequencies and the two stimulus levels (softer or louder than the first). And fourth, primes were now either compatible or incompatible with the targets. The experimental task consisted of six blocks of 32 trials each. Stimulus timing was carefully monitored and sporadic trials with longer prime-mask or mask-target SOAs (due to sporadic asynchrony of the visual output with the vertical refresh rate) were excluded (two trials across all participants and both experiments). Prime direction, target direction and the four threshold values (obtained from the four staircases in the pre-test) were pseudo-randomly distributed across each block, so that none of these were predictable from any of the others on a given trial. 2.2.5 Control task: prime recognition After the experimental task, existence of the primes was revealed to participants and a forced choice prime recognition task was added (the control task). Visual stimulation was identical to the experimental task, but participants were instructed to ignore the direction of the target arrows as well as the mask and to focus on the direction of the primes only. They were required to indicate whether primes pointed to the right or the left on each trial (by using the respective index finger buttons). There was no time limit for these responses. However, participants had to wait for a tone (875Hz, 150ms, presented 600ms after the onset of the target) before responding. This constraint for reaction times was introduced to keep the influence of subliminal priming on the button choice to a minimum and follows procedures used in previous studies for the same purpose (Chambon & Haggard, 2012; Vorberg, Mattler, Heinecke, Schmidt, & Schwarzbach, 2003; Wenke et al., 2010). There was no feedback for this prime recognition task. The prime recognition task consisted of three blocks, each of 32 trials. 2.3 Data analysis Data on loudness discrimination in the experimental task and on prime recognition in the control task were analysed using signal detection theory measures (Green & Swets, 1966). Participants whose sensitivity for prime direction in the prime recognition task exceeded a threshold (d′>0.5) were excluded (three participants in experiment 1 (d′ of 3.77, 1.49 and 1.19). The main behavioural metric of interest relating to the experimental task was the bias to report the first of the two tones as the softer as a measure of sensory attenuation. Sensory attenuation has been known to decay over the course of a few hundred milliseconds (Aliu, Houde, & Nagarajan, 2009; Bays et al., 2005). The bias to report the first tone, which was presented 50ms after the action, as the softer one (relative to the second tone 1150ms after the action) can therefore reflect sensory attenuation. We used the log likelihood ratio ln(β) as a measure of bias, i.e., the natural logarithm of the ratio of the values of the two signal distributions at the decision criterion (Macmillan & Creelman, 2005). In the widely-used (Wickens, 2002) equal-variance Gaussian model of the two distributions, ln(β) equals half of the difference of the squared z-transforms of the false alarm rate (F) and hit rate (H): ln ( β ) = 0.5 ∗ ( z 2 ( F ) - z 2 ( H ) ) Systematic differences of ln(β) between conditions were not explained by systematic changes in sensitivity (d′) as d′ was not affected significantly by condition in both experiments (see results). Effects of prime–target compatibility on reaction times, error rates and ln(β) were tested with dependent samples t-tests across subjects. A one-tailed t test was used where the direction of the effect has previously been established in the previous literature, i.e., when testing for priming effects on reaction time and error rates. For priming effects on our measure of sensory attenuation, a two-tailed t test was used. Within-subject effects were tested using independent samples t-tests. 3 Results Our main focus was on the bias to report the first of the two tones in the experimental task as the softer. We also measured prime–target compatibility effects on inverse efficiency, a measure that efficiently combines response speed and accuracy (Townsend & Ashby, 1983). We report results relating to bias under “Experimental task”. For completeness, we first report results of the pre-test. 3.1 Pre-test The staircase procedure of the pre-test resulted in four loudness discrimination thresholds for each individual, representing volume levels above and below the volume of the standard tone (74dB SPL) for each of the two tone frequencies (900Hz vs. 750Hz). Loudness discrimination thresholds were not significantly modulated by these two factors (factor 1: volume of the sample tone with respect to the volume of the standard tone [louder, softer], factor 2: tone frequency [900Hz, 750Hz]) as revealed by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. On average, discrimination thresholds were based on 16.3 reversals (averaged across the four staircases and all participants). There were no significant differences in the number of reversals between the four staircases (all p >.25). Mean discrimination thresholds for the four staircases were 1.19dB SPL (750Hz, staircase approaching 74dB SPL from below), 1.05dB SPL (750Hz, staircase approaching 74dB SPL from above), 1.02dB SPL (900Hz, staircase approaching 74dB SPL from below) and 1.1dB SPL (900Hz, staircase approaching 74dB SPL from above). 3.2 Experimental task As expected, prime–target compatibility significantly modulated efficiency of instructed button presses. Consistent with the literature on negative compatibility effects, compatibly primed responses were significantly less efficient than incompatibly primed responses (t 12 =6.5, p <.001; inverse efficiency (mean±SD): 433.95±70.17ms (compatible primes) vs. 372.59±78.13ms (incompatible primes)). Participants responded significantly more slowly to compatibly primed targets when compared to incompatibly primed targets (t 12 =8.14, p <.001; reaction time (mean±SD): 423.33±77.64ms (compatible primes) vs. 372.32±78.23ms (incompatible primes)) (Fig. 2 a) and with a significantly higher error rate (t 12 =2.05, p =0.032; error rates (mean±SD): 2.65±4.52% (compatible primes) vs. 0.08±0.28% (incompatible primes)) (Fig. 2b). Eleven (out of thirteen) participants showed a significant negative compatibility effect in a fixed-effect analysis (independent samples t-test across trials). Importantly, prime–target compatibility also significantly modulated bias in our loudness discrimination task. The bias to report the first of the two tones as the softer one was increased in trials in which primes and targets were compatible when compared to incompatibly primed trials (t 12 =2.34, p =.037) (Fig. 2c). Sensitivity, on the other hand, as indexed by d′, was not affected significantly by prime–target compatibility (t 12 =1.49, p =.16). Thus, compatibility of primes and targets decreased motor efficiency and, in parallel, increased the bias to report the first of two auditory action consequences as the less intense, i.e., softer. 4 Discussion We demonstrate that the perceived loudness of an auditory consequence of a motor action is attenuated by an experimental manipulation that selectively influences motor processing, in the absence of any changes to stimulus predictability. Specifically, we show that perceived loudness and motor efficiency are both decreased in parallel when the action is primed by a compatible, subliminally presented, visual prime–target pair with a long SOA (Eimer, 1999; Lingnau & Vorberg, 2005; Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2000). In previous studies (Chambon & Haggard, 2012; Wenke et al., 2010), this experimental manipulation has been shown to enhance explicit judgements regarding the degree of control over sensory stimuli. However, such explicit judgements may be subject to post hoc interpretative reconstruction. Therefore, they do not provide a direct measure of sense of agency. In contrast, sensory attenuation provides a low-level sensory measure related to sense of agency (Synofzik et al., 2008), with the advantage of a clear link to a strong theoretical model that identifies specific aspects of action processing (i.e., the feed-forward predictor and the comparator stage). Several other studies have appreciated the value of implicit, perceptual measures of the sense of agency (Shergill et al., 2005), but we believe ours may be the first such study to do so while avoiding any confounding effects related to action-stimulus contingency. 4.1 Deconfounding experimental studies of sense of agency Our study was partly motivated by concerns about confounds in previous studies on sensory attenuation. Sensory attenuation is, by definition, action-specific (Bays et al., 2005; Chapman, Bushnell, Miron, Duncan, & Lund, 1987) and studies on sensory attenuation should be able to unambiguously attribute observed changes in perception to motor actions. Ideally, all parameters of an action-stimulus sequence should remain constant across experimental and control conditions to avoid confounding those effects that are due to the manipulation of interest – e.g. due to manipulations of experienced stimulus causation – and those that arise from any changes to stimulus presentation with respect to the action. Despite such potential pitfalls, most previous studies on sensory attenuation are based on study designs that manipulate the contingency between an action and a stimulus and may therefore lead to different levels of stimulus predictability. Given the ubiquitous perceptual effects of predictability, these confounds make judgements of stimulus intensity problematic. For example, some previous studies on sensory attenuation have compared stimuli that are contingent on an action (in “motor-to-effect” conditions) to identical stimuli that are not preceded by a motor command of the observer (in “effect only” conditions) (e.g. Weiss et al., 2011). This design could confound authorship over action consequences with motor processing. Other studies have tried to avoid this confound by manipulating the “when” or “what” of action consequences, i.e., the time lag between the action and its consequence (e.g. Bäss et al., 2008) or the mapping of various actions onto different consequences (e.g. Cardoso-Leite et al., 2010). Such designs successfully control for predictability of stimulus occurrence, but still need to control for predictability of stimulus onset timing, or stimulus identity (for a review of these confounds in previous studies, see Hughes et al., 2013). A recent EEG study used subliminal priming of sensory action consequences (rather than priming of the motor action itself, as in our study) to demonstrate a neurophysiological correlate of sensory attenuation (of visually evoked responses) (Gentsch & Schütz-Bosbach, 2011). The concept of modulating the experience of control over stimuli by (subliminal or conscious) priming of these action consequences prior to the action stems from studies on explicit agency judgements (Aarts, Custers, & Wegner, 2005; Linser & Goschke, 2007; Wegner & Wheatley, 1999). However, priming of sensory action consequences (“effect priming” rather than motor priming) might by-pass specifically action-mediated effects on perception and alter sensory processing directly, i.e., via stimulus–stimulus associations, which are potentially independent of the action. Studies that are based on priming of sensory action consequences (rather than the motor action itself) cannot unambiguously attribute observed sensory effects to the preceding action. This reservation remains even if no effect of the sensory priming is observed in control conditions that lack the action (since these control conditions raise similar issues as studies that compare “motor-to-effect” conditions and “effect only” conditions, as described above). In contrast, our study design dissociates the primary target of the experimental manipulation – the action – from the outcome measure of interest – perceived loudness – and thus provides strong support for the proposal that perceived loudness is indeed modulated through the action, as our measures of sensory attenuation and motor performance co-varied with prime–target compatibility. 4.2 Motor processing and negative compatibility priming We hypothesised that sensory attenuation would be stronger when actions were compatibly primed. This hypothesis was based on the finding that the experience of control is enhanced when primes and targets are compatible (Chambon & Haggard, 2012) and on the proposed association of sensory attenuation and the sense of agency (Shergill et al., 2005). Direct support for this specific direction of the priming effect on sensory attenuation comes from studies on motor priming. A model of self-inhibitory neural circuits has been proposed to explain negative compatibility effects on motor performance (Eimer & Schlaghecken, 2003), based on recordings of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) in conjunction with behavioural measures of motor efficiency (Eimer & Schlaghecken, 1998). According to this model, an initial facilitation of the correct motor response automatically turns into inhibition of the correct response when primes and targets are further separated in time (but see Jaśkowski, 2008). This prime-induced, automatic, inhibitory effect has been considered to be dissociable from the effects of resolving the subsequent response conflict induced by prime–target compatibility (D’Ostilio et al., 2012). In our study, only trials that showed correct responses to targets were taken into account. These were trials in which the conflict between automatic motor inhibition and target instruction was successfully resolved and motor inhibition was overcome. Previous studies have demonstrated that physiological signals of motor processing are enhanced when response conflict induced by prime–target compatibility is resolved in favour of the correct response. More specifically, an increase in blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in the supplementary motor area has been shown (Boy, Evans, et al., 2010) as well as a larger amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential at the time of the response (Figs. 2 and 4 in Eimer & Schlaghecken, 1998; Eimer & Schlaghecken, 2003, respectively) in compatible vs. incompatible trials. This suggests an enhanced neural representation of the chosen action in compatible vs. incompatible trials when auto-inhibition is overcome, and, consecutively, may imply higher accuracy (Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith, 2000) or precision (Brown et al., 2013) of sensory predictions. In line with this, we find stronger sensory attenuation when actions are compatibly primed. 4.3 Bias and sensitivity in sensory attenuation We used bias in a discrimination task as a measure of sensory attenuation, similar to previous studies that reported shifts in the point of subjective equality (Desantis, Weiss, Schütz-Bosbach, & Waszak, 2012; Haggard & Whitford, 2004; Weiss et al., 2011). Early studies on sensory attenuation reported detection rates and magnitude estimation as outcome measures (Chapman et al., 1987), which can, in principle, reflect either sensitivity or bias or both (Macmillan & Creelman, 2005). Indeed, a prominent example of sensory attenuation, the force-matching illusion (Shergill, Bays, Frith, & Wolpert, 2003), is a shift of both the point of subjective equality and the slope of the psychometric function. From a theoretical perspective, the comparator model predicts signal cancellation, not a change in the sensory gain function (but see Brown et al., 2013). The effects of signal cancellation on the two main signal detection theory measures, sensitivity and bias, depend on the choice of task design. In a detection paradigm, both signal cancellation and gain reduction predict a decrease in sensitivity. Accordingly, a previous study that was based on a detection paradigm found effects of response – stimulus congruency (with respect to a learnt mapping) on sensitivity (Cardoso-Leite et al., 2010). In discrimination paradigms, however, mere cancellation of a sensory signal leads to a perceptual bias, whereas a change of sensory gain affects both signal amplitude and variance and, thereby, discriminability from the reference stimulus, i.e., discrimination sensitivity. Experiments that require high predictability of the signal for conceptual reasons, such as studies on sensory attenuation, may profit from a design based on signal discrimination, as a discrimination task allows to present the same signal on every trial and to vary the reference stimulus only. Furthermore, absence of an effect on sensitivity in signal discrimination tasks, as in our study, speaks against any major, potentially confounding effects on attention. Attentional effects would typically affect the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., the sensory gain function (Hillyard, Vogel, & Luck, 1998), resulting in altered sensitivity. In principle, phenomena interpreted as sensory attenuation might occur at an early sensory level as well as at higher, decision-related stages. As outlined above, previous studies interpret both sensitivity and bias effects as sensory attenuation. Studies that show a decrease of early electrophysiological components of sensory processing typically suffer from those potential confounds, e.g. by stimulus predictability, that our experiment aimed to address (e.g. Gentsch & Schütz-Bosbach, 2011). Taken together, the previous literature on sensory attenuation cannot conclusively attribute sensory attenuation phenomena to purely perceptual or pure decision processes. Our study was not designed to dissociate between perceptual and decision-related components of sensory attenuation. We focussed more on the motor locus of the signals causing sensory attenuation than on the sensory (or any other) locus where the attenuating effect occurred. However, our results make a purely decisional effect unlikely, since response mappings in the speeded reaction time task and in the loudness discrimination task were orthogonal (indeed, buttons for the two tasks were arranged orthogonal to each other). 4.4 Priming and unconscious processing Our results are also relevant to the wider questions of how unconscious stimuli can modulate cognition (Kouider & Dehaene, 2007). Previous studies have demonstrated that subliminal priming can influence perceptual, lexical, semantic and motor processing (Dehaene et al., 1998; Kouider & Dehaene, 2007). Wenke et al. (2010) and Chambon and Haggard (2012) further showed that unconscious perception can affect conscious experience of control over the consequence of an action. The authors argued that such action priming effects were mediated by signals arising from action preparation, i.e., from within the motor system. Here, we demonstrate that subliminal priming effects extend beyond motor processing to the conscious perception of the consequence of an action. Would supraliminal primes produce similar effects to those we have observed with subliminal primes? Previous studies with the NCE disagreed regarding the relation between prime visibility and priming effects on motor performance (Eimer & Schlaghecken, 2002; Schlaghecken, Blagrove, & Maylor, 2008). Here, we excluded three participants based on relatively high sensitivity in the prime recognition task. Our rationale for excluding these participants was that Wenke et al. reported very different results of motor priming on the experience of control depending on prime visibility (2010). In line with this observation, we found a trend towards a significant difference in the priming effect on our measure of sensory attenuation between participants who were excluded and the rest (independent samples t-test, t 14 =2.11, p =.053; mean shift in bias from compatible to incompatible trials, ±SD: −0.32±0.41 (excluded participants) and 0.31±0.48 (included participants)). This offers some circumstantial evidence that consciously seeing the primes reverses their effect on perceived outcome intensity. Whereas subliminal primes produce a negative compatibility effect on both motor performance and sensory attenuation, supraliminal primes have, if anything, the opposite effect. This may indicate that prime awareness is a predictor of (the direction of) priming effects on sensory attenuation. However, this is just circumstantial evidence and should be treated with caution: stronger evidence would come from an experiment designed to address the issue of prime visibility. In the meantime, it is possible that the internal, motoric sense of agency studied here operates in a form of competitive inhibition with other, external attributions of consequent stimuli. A supraliminal prime might provide an alternative potential cause to which the consequent tone could be attributed, and this would then weaken the motoric sense of agency. In summary, based on a well-controlled, theoretically pure design, our study demonstrates that sensory attenuation of action consequences is driven by top-down modulation of perception specifically via motor processing. Conversely, our results show that effects of subliminal motor priming extend beyond motor execution to conscious perception of sensory action consequences. Our approach provides the basis for future studies that focus on behaviourally relevant neural mechanisms underlying sensory attenuation.

Highlights • A new reward-repeat task that allows monkeys to report valuations of sequences. • Predictable biases in monkeys’ evaluations of sequences similar to human biases. • Monkeys are biased towards sequences with larger values near end. • Peak-bias evoked by weak working-memory challenge. Abstract Movies, vacations, and meals are all examples of events composed of a sequence of smaller events. How do we go from our evaluations of each scene in a movie to an evaluation of the sequence as a whole? In theory, we should simply average the values of the individual events. In practice, however, we are biased towards sequences where each element tends to be better than the previous, where the last value is large, and we overweight the best (or worst) part of the sequence. To study how general these biases are we examined monkeys’ preferences for sequences of rewards in a novel reward repeat task. Monkeys were first given a sequence of rewards and then chose between repeating the sequence or receiving a standard comparator sequence. We found that, like humans, monkeys overweight events that happen later in a sequence, so much so that adding a small reward to the end of a sequence can paradoxically reduce its value. Monkeys were also biased towards sequences with large peak values (the highest value in the sequence), but only following a working memory challenge, suggesting that this preference may be driven by memory limitations. These results demonstrate the cross-species nature of biases in preferences for sequences of outcomes. In addition, monkeys’ consistent preference for sequences in which large values occur later challenges the generality of discounting models of intertemporal choice in animals. Keywords Heuristics Biases Intertemporal choice Peak-end Macaque 1 Introduction We must often evaluate experiences that occur over extended periods of time and involve a mix of reward intensities and valences (Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993). For example, how much did we enjoy a specific two-hour movie, three-course meal, or seven-day vacation? And how much would we pay for another similar sequence? To make these evaluations, we must mentally combine the utilities of multiple individual moments into a single value. In theory we should just sum the experienced utilities of the constituent events – the order of events occur should not matter. How much we feel we have enjoyed a movie should just be a function of how much we enjoyed each scene individually. However, human and animal decision-makers typically discount rewards as an increasing function of delay (Rachlin, 2004). One would expect, then, that we would prefer sequences with the highest valued events early (Frederick, Loewenstein, & O’Donoghue, 2002; Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993), meaning a movie with a strong start would be preferred to one with a strong ending. Common sense dictates that the overall utility of an experience is the sum (or average) utility of its components. Discounting models predict that, because we prefer rewards sooner rather than later, we should invariably prefer declining sequences to improving ones that are matched for average value. Contrary to both of these, humans often prefer sequences to increase in value over time (Ariely, 1998; Chapman, 1996; Chapman, 2000; Frank & Hutchens, 1993; Hsee, Abelson, & Salovey, 1991; Hsee & Abelson, 1991; Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993; Loewenstein & Sicherman, 1991; Prelec & Loewenstein, 1991; Ross & Simonson, 1991). Closely related biases motivate us to value sequences in which the more positive events occurred near the end (the end bias), sequences with greater peak intensities regardless of when they occur (the peak bias), and sequences with increasing reward intensity (the trend bias) (Kahneman, Fredrickson, Schreiber, & Redelmeier, 1993; Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993; Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996). That is, we would expect that people overweight the best scene and ending of a movie when reporting how much they enjoyed the film. Together, these biases are a defining feature of our intertemporal preferences. These preference patterns apply to positive and aversive domains, have been confirmed in field studies, and may be harnessed to improve health and welfare (Clark & Georgellis, 2004; Do, Rupert, & Wolford, 2008; Kahneman, 1999; Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996; Redelmeier, Katz, & Kahneman, 2003). So robust are these effects that merely reframing rewards as being part of a sequence rather than independent events can cause a switch in preference from decreasing towards increasing sequences (Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993). Together, these results pose a major challenge to standard theories about temporal allocation of rewards and suggest that psychological factors can overwhelm discounting preferences in intertemporal choice (Frederick, Loewenstein, & O’Donoghue, 2002). Understanding animal economic preferences provides an important point of comparison with human economic preferences (Real, 1991; Stevens & Stephens, 2010). Studies of animals economic preferences in the laboratory have provided a great deal of information about the cognitive processes they use to make decisions, giving us insight into the mental lives of animals (Brosnan & de Waal, 2003; Brosnan et al., 2007; Chen, Lakshminarayanan, & Santos, 2006; Egan, Bloom, & Santos, 2010). We know almost nothing about how animals evaluate sequences of rewards (but see Xu, Knight, & Kralik, 2011). The well-established steep discounting observed across taxa would predict that animals strongly prefer decreasing sequences to flat ones and flat ones to increasing ones. We studied the preferences of three rhesus monkeys in a simple sequence preference task. Rhesus monkeys offer an ideal model organism for studying intertemporal preferences – their psychology is well studied, they are flexible learners that do not readily fall into behavioral stereotypies, and they have time preferences that are similar to those of other animals (Glimcher, Kable, & Louie, 2007; Kim, Hwang, & Lee, 2008; Stevens, Rosati, Ross, & Hauser, 2005). On each trial of our novel reward repeat task, monkeys were given a sequence of five rewards and then offered a choice between repeating that sequence or obtaining a well-learned comparator sequence consisting of five repeats of a single value (either [2.22.22.22.22.2], [33333], [3.43.43.43.43.4], or [44444]). We then estimated a subjective value for each probe sequence by fitting a preference function. We found that monkeys assign more decision weight to events later in the sequence. Indeed, the addition of a small reward at the end of a sequence can, paradoxically, reduce its value (cf. Kahneman et al., 1993; Schreiber & Kahneman, 2000). These results are reminiscent of those observed in humans and suggest that similar heuristics are employed by humans and monkeys in guiding choices over extended sequences. Unlike humans, monkeys did not prefer sequences with large peaks in the standard version of our task, although we induced a peak bias in monkeys by adding a weak working memory challenge (a four second delay preceding choice). Collectively, these results highlight the potential importance of memory in driving preferences and challenge discounting models of animal intertemporal preferences. 2 Methods 2.1 Behavioral task Trials were randomly chosen from a larger set of possible sequences and interleaved. We collected about twice as much data from subject H as from subjects J and K. The amount of data collected was determined by subject and experimenter availability and was not in any way determined by examining data. No subjects were excluded from the study. Our computer monitor had a 1024×768 resolution and was placed 144.8cm (57in.) in front of the subjects. Each trial of the task consisted of three steps: Step 1, probe reward: The probe cue appeared (a photograph of some rocks, see Fig. 1 ). After 500ms, a sequence of five fluid rewards was given, each separated from the next by 500ms. The duration of the rewards ranged from 20ms to 80ms. The time required to give the reward did not slow down the delivery of the next reward. The identity of the rewards varied with task condition (see below). When the number zero appears in a sequence, this indicates no reward was given but a 500ms delay still occurred. In the one four-step sequence [2228], no delay was imposed at the end. In the working memory challenge variant of the task, a four-second delay was added at the end of the probe reward period and before the choice; the monitor was kept blank during this time. Note that, for ease of description, values are normalized to a standard value of 1=0.01mL. Step 2, choice: Following a 500ms delay, two targets appeared, centered 16.5 degrees of visual angle to the left and right of the central spot. The probe stimulus consisted of the same neutral photographic stimulus that appeared in Step 1 (the picture of rocks). The comparator stimulus consisted of a solid colored vertically oriented rectangle (80×300pixels). The comparator was one of four colors (orange, yellow, gray, or blue) indicating the associated reward size. Choice of the comparator offered one a sequence of five repeats of the same size (2.2, 3.0, 3.4, and 4.0, respectively). The side on which the probe and comparator were shown was chosen randomly on each trial. Monkeys made their choice by shifting gaze to the chosen target. Step 3, reward: 500ms following the monkeys’ choice, the chosen reward was given. Choice of the probe offered an immediate repeat of the sequence that was given in Step 1. After that, an inter-trial interval of 1s occurred. 2.2 Training All three subjects were previously extensively trained to perform simple decision making tasks involving making saccades to targets for rewards. Two of the subjects (H and J) performed, among other tasks, intertemporal choice tasks; the other subject (K) did not. All three subjects were familiar with the mappings between colors and reward size, which are maintained across all tasks within the lab. Training involved a stepwise series of tasks building towards the standard task. Subjects were required to be trained for at least 2weeks, and were not allowed to begin data collection until they were able to perform a simplified version of the task at 75% accuracy for three days in a row. (This simplified version involved four uniform sequences equal to the standard sequences; accuracy in this version was choosing the option, probe or comparator, with the larger total reward.) In practice, all three subjects took about two weeks to meet this criterion. 2.3 Statistics Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) was used for all computations. The point of subjective equivalence (PSE) was computed by fitting a sigmoidal curve to the preference data and then computing the point where this curve crossed the indifference (i.e. 50% choice) line (similar methods were used in Hayden, Parikh, Deaner, & Platt, 2007 and Hayden et al., 2007). Standard errors were estimated using a jackknife method (as in Hayden et al., 2007). Specifically, we repeated the calculation of PSE on a subset of 95% of the data, randomly selected. Then we repeated this procedure 20 times, using different random sets (without replacement) and used these 20 estimates to compute the standard error. The jackknife standard deviation was defined as the standard error multiplied by the square root of 20. Computing whether ordered variables have a significant effect on computed variables like PSE presents a special problem for analysis because we cannot use simple linear regression (we are referring here to the analyses shown in Figs. 2 C and 3 A–C). We therefore devised a novel statistical technique using a bootstrap methodology, which we refer to above as a bootstrap permutation test . We first performed a random statistical resampling of the dataset (with replacement) to generate a resampled version of the dataset (of the same size as the original). We then computed the PSE for each of the elements of this resampled distribution and then calculated the slope of the best-fit line through these points. We then repeated this process 20,000 times and counted the proportion of times the slope crossed over zero. We multiplied this proportion by two (because we wanted to get a two-tailed t-test) to estimate the p-value for the claim. 2.4 Subjects All procedures were approved by the University of Rochester Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were designed and conducted in compliance with the Public Health Service’s Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. Three male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) served as subjects. Initially, each animal was provided with a small mount to facilitate head positioning using standard techniques (Blanchard, Pearson, & Hayden, 2013). Subjects were habituated to laboratory conditions and trained to perform decision tasks for liquid reward. Standard reinforcement training was used with only positive fluid rewards; punishment was never used, nor was aversive conditioning. 3 Results On each trial of our novel reward repeat task (Fig. 1), monkeys first experienced a sequence of five liquid rewards (probe sequence) and then immediately chose between two options: (a) repeating the probe sequence of rewards, (b) taking one of four standard comparator sequences. The probe sequence is chosen randomly each trial from a larger set of possible sequences (the larger set of sequences is determined by the experimental condition). For ease of description in this manuscript, all juice volumes are normalized to a standard value of 1 aliquot=0.01mL. Comparator sequences consisted of five repeats of a single value (either 2.2, 3, 3.4, or 4), were well-learned during training, were explicitly cued by color, and varied randomly each trial. By fitting a sigmoidal curve to preference as a function of probe sequence value, we estimated a subjective value for each probe sequence (Hayden, Heilbronner, & Platt, 2010; Hayden et al., 2007) (see Section 2.3). 3.1 Preferences for uniform sequences confirm basic behavioral coherence We first examined monkeys’ evaluation of probe sequences consisting of five identical options. Fig. 2A shows the average frequency of choices for each sequence ([22222], [3.23.23.23.23.2], [3.63.63.63.63.6], and [44444]) against the four comparator sequences [2.22.22.22.22.2], [33333], [3.43.43.43.43.4], and [44444]. Monkeys choose the greater valued sequence more often than the less valued ones (regression of preference against probe value, β =0.10, p =0.0002). The same patterns are observed for each monkey individually (subject H: β =0.11, p =0.02; subject J: β =0.09, p =0.01; subject K: β =0.07, p =0.04). We next examined the influence of session by treating it as a random effect in a multi-variable ANOVA (subject×sequence×session). We found no influence of session (p =0.1374, DF=36, sum of squares=7.306, F =1.26) or of subject (p =0.173, DF=2, sum of squares=0.549, F =1.76), although we did find a significant effect of sequence (p =0.0003, DF=3, sum of squares=3.003, F =6.41). To determine the value placed on each sequence, we next estimated the point of subjective equivalence (PSE)for each sequence (illustrated in Fig. 2B). To do so, we separated choices by the value of the standard comparator. Data for the probe sequence [3.23.23.23.23.2] are shown in Fig. 2B; the four comparators appear on the x-axis. We then fit the data to a sigmoidal curve. We defined the PSE as the point where this sigmoidal curve crosses the indifference line (i.e. 50% choice of probe and 50% choice of standard), indicating equal valuation of the two options. The PSE provides an estimate of the subjective value placed on the sequence of options in terms of the value of the standard comparators. The PSE for this sequence was 4.0 (±0.43 standard error), indicating that monkeys treated this sequence as if it had a value equivalent to [44444]. The difference between this decision value for a sequence and its actual value, 0.8 (for each element in the sequence), provides a measure of monkeys’ intrinsic preference for the probe option vs. the comparator. This probe premium was roughly constant for all four uniform sequences used in Experiment 1 and for each of the three monkeys. Indeed, we found no relationship between the probe premium and probe value (we used a novel bootstrap slope test for this analysis, see Section 2.3; we abbreviate slope as m, m =0.023, p =0.55). Our data do not provide any information about why the probe sequences were preferred to the comparators; we speculate that this difference may reflect a preference for variable, novel, or informative options (Bromberg-Martin & Hikosaka, 2009; Hayden, Heilbronner, Nair, & Platt, 2008; Heilbronner & Hayden, 2013). Fig. 2C shows the PSE for all four probe sequences used in Experiment 1, [22222], [3.23.23.23.23.2], [3.63.63.63.63.6], and [44444]. Not surprisingly, we found a clear monotonic relationship between probe value and decision value. We observed a significant positive relationship between probe value and PSE for the group of three monkeys and for each monkey individually (using the bootstrap slope test). Specifically, m =0.9 (units for slope are aliquots per trial divided by a categorical dummy variable), p <0.0001 for the group of monkeys (subject H: m =1.1, p <0.0001; subject J: m =0.7, p =0.0009; subject K: m =0.55, p =0.033). Together these data indicate that monkeys have no trouble understanding the task. These data also indicate that monkeys have well-behaved, systematic preferences over the options and a clear preference for the probe over the comparator option. 3.2 Monkeys prefer sequences with large rewards at the end We next examined how monkeys evaluate increasing, flat, and decreasing sequences (Fig. 3A). We first examined the rising sequence [12346], the flat sequence [3.23.23.23.23.2], and the falling sequence [64321]. These three sequences, as well as most used in this study, have the same total value (16). We found a clear preference for the increasing sequence (bootstrap t-test, p <0.0001 for the group, p <0.0001 for H, p <0.001 for J and K) and a clear preference for the flat sequence over the decreasing one (p <0.008 for the group, and p =0.012 for H, p =0.015 for J and p =0.029 for K). Thus monkeys prefer sequences to increase in value rather than decrease. These preferences are inconsistent with discounting theories, which predict preference for decreasing sequences, and are reminiscent of human preferences for increasing sequences (Ariely, 1998; Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993). We next examined the influence of session by treating it as a random effect in a multi-variable ANOVA (subject×sequence×session) on the raw preference data (not the PSE fit data). We found no influence of session (p =0.3805, DF=36, sum of squares=7.533, F =1.06) or of subject (p =0.4791, DF=2, sum of squares=0.284, F =0.74). We then examined the effect of position on preference (Fig. 3B). We tested five reward sequences [82222], [28222], [22822], [22282], and [22228]. These sequences are identical except for the temporal position of the large reward. We found a clear and roughly linear increase in value for sequences with later positioning of the large reward. Specifically we found values of m =0.08 (units for slope are aliquots per trial divided by a categorical dummy variable), p <0.0001 for the group (subject H: m =0.083, p <0.0001; subject J: m =0.096, p =0.01; subject K: m =0.062, p =0.01). These data confirm that the order in which options are presented matters to monkeys in determining preference, and that larger rewards presented later in the sequence are preferred to larger rewards sooner. This pattern of preferences is consistent with the preference for increasing sequences observed in humans and is somewhat consistent with the end bias (Ariely, 1998; Kahneman et al., 1993; Schreiber & Kahneman, 2000). We next examined the possible confounding factor of session and/or subject by treating them as a random effect in a multi-variable ANOVA (subject×sequence×session) on the raw preference data (not the PSE fit data). We found no influence of session (p =0.6111, DF=36, sum of squares=6.43, F =0.92) or of subject (p =0.8103, DF=2, sum of squares=0.08, F =0.21). We thus infer that sequence order was the critical factor. Monkeys’ valuations of sequences appear to contradict the discounting hypothesis, that monkeys steeply discount future rewards over the course of a few seconds (Rachlin, 2004). This hypothesis predicts that monkeys should inevitably prefer decreasing sequences (Frederick, Loewenstein, & O’Donoghue, 2002). However, the intertemporal choice tasks that are used to support the discounting hypothesis generally use single rewards. Thus it is possible that monkeys show anti-discounting behavior in our reward repeat task because of some bias caused by multiple rewards. To test this idea, we examined valuations for three sequences, [80000], [00800], and [00008] (Fig. 3C). Zeros here correspond to half-second periods with no reward (or any other novel cue). Again, we found a clear pattern of preferences for large reward later. Specifically, we found a significant effect of position on value using the bootstrap permutation test, m =0.12, p <0.0004 for the group (subject H: p =0.006; subject J: p =0.04; subject K: p =0.011). Interestingly, the probe premium for these sequences (roughly 2.0 across animals and conditions) was greater than that observed for other, more valuable sequences (about 0.8, as noted above). Within the hyperbolic discounting framework, the present results can only be accounted for by a negative discount factor k (that is, rewards are more valuable when delayed than when immediate). Because our monkeys have positive ks in standard discounting tasks (Blanchard et al., 2013), we surmise that the discounting parameter measured by intertemporal choice tasks may have poor external validity, as suggested by earlier work (Bateson & Kacelnik, 1996; Blanchard et al., 2013; Pavlic & Passino, 2010; Pearson, Hayden, & Platt, 2010; Stephens & Anderson, 2001). We next examined the possible confounding factor of session and/or subject by treating them as a random effect in a multi-variable ANOVA (subject×sequence×session) on the raw preference data (not the PSE fit data). We found no influence of session (p =0.9645 DF=36, sum of squares=5.002, F =0.62) or of subject (p =0.733, DF=2, sum of squares=0.136, F =0.31). 3.3 Paradoxical effect of adding a small reward Human studies have shown that adding a punisher to the end of a sequence of negative events can, paradoxically, increase preference for that sequence if the punisher is less aversive than earlier events (Schreiber & Kahneman, 2000). For example, holding one’s hand in a bucket of 14° water for one minute and then an additional 30s while the water is raised to 15° (still unpleasant but less so) is generally preferred to the one minute 14° water event alone (Kahneman et al., 1993). Similar effects have been observed with positive experiences (Fredrickson & Kahneman, 1993; Shizgal, 1999). We therefore wondered whether adding a small reward to the end of a sequence might decrease preference for it. We thus next compared valuations for the sequences [2228] and [22281] (Fig. 4 ). Because the first sequence had one fewer element and was therefore 500ms shorter, we were concerned that monkeys might choose it in order to hasten the beginning of the next trial and increase reward intake rate (Blanchard et al., 2013). We therefore added another condition with the same timing as the [22281] sequence, [22280]. We found that monkeys preferred [2228] and [22280] to [22281], despite the fact that the sequence [22281] offers more total reward (15 vs. 14). These effects are significant (bootstrap permutation test, p =0.004 for the subjects together, p <0.05 for each of the three subjects individually). We found no significant difference in preference between [2228] and [22280], suggesting that timing does not contribute strongly to preferences in this condition (bootstrap permutation test, p =0.18 for the group of three subjects, p >0.05 for each of the individual subjects). We can also look at the sequence [22282] from the earlier section. The PSE for this sequence (4.11) was significantly lower than the PSE for [2228] (4.2, bootstrap permutation test, p =0.044). These results indicate that even increasing a sequence’s value by 2 (that is, by about 14% of the value of the original sequence) is not enough to overcome the reduction in preference induced by ending with a lower value in this context. It is not clear why the sequence [22280] is not treated as a sequence with a very low end value. We conjecture that the single zero at the end of [22280] may be more readily ignored than the two and four zeroes at the end of the other one-element sequences. 3.4 Later elements in the sequence have greater influence on evaluations Taken together, these data indicate that, within the context of this task, monkeys prefer sequences with increasing values and that they are particularly motivated by large values at the end of a sequence. One possible explanation for these data is that monkeys place more weight on items later in the sequence. To test this idea, we next measured valuations in a random sequence variant of the reward repeat task. In this version of the task, every element of every sequence on every trial was chosen at random by the computer. Rewards in each of the five steps of the sequence were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. (Random selection was made with replacement, so it was possible for the same element to reappear, and sequence average values were not constrained). We regressed preferences (as defined by PSE, see Section 2.3) against reward value in each position, which were independent of each other (Fig. 5 ). We found that monkeys’ regression coefficients increase roughly linearly with step number. Specifically, we found a significant increase in regression coefficient with step number for the group (bootstrap permutation test, p <0.0001) and for each monkey individually (p <0.0001 for H, p =0.006 for J and p =0.044 for K). These effects indicate that the size of the reward later in the sequence has a greater effect on preference than the size of the reward earlier in the sequence. We next examined the possible confounding factor of session and/or subject by treating them as a random effect in a multi-variable ANOVA (subject×sequence×session) on the raw preference data (not the PSE fit data). We found no influence of session (p =0.7476 DF=6, sum of squares=0.673, F =0.58) or of subject (p =0.4171, DF=2, sum of squares=0.339, F =0.88). 3.5 Peak bias and working memory challenge Besides the end bias and preference for improving sequences, humans have a pronounced peak bias . That is, we often prefer sequences with a single large value to ones with a higher total value but a smaller peak (Do et al., 2008). We observed no evidence of peak biases in our data. Fig. 6 A shows the relative preferences for three sequences with the same average value but different peak levels: [22822], [23532], and [24442]. These sequences have identical end values and the same slope (i.e. no overall increase). Indeed, we found a significant preference for flatter sequences for the group and for two of the three monkeys individually. Specifically a bootstrap permutation test showed m =0.35, p <0.004 for the group (subject H: m =0.41, p =0.041; subject J: m =0.30, p =0.0039; subject K exhibited a non-significant trend in the same direction: m =0.18, p =0.081). Note that the preference for flatness within these sequences could be explained by the greater decision weight placed upon later elements in the sequence (see Section 3.4), or possibly by a preference for spreading (Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993). One possible explanation for the impact of peak values on human retrospective evaluations of sequences is that peak values are over-weighted in memory (Rozin, Rozin, & Goldberg, 2004). Such memory effects may be less important in our task, where the decision occurs less than a second after the end of the sequence. If so, then increasing the working memory load of the task might increase relative preference for peaked sequences. To test this idea, we compared preferences for the same three sequences as above ([22822], [23532], [24442]) in a weak working memory challenge condition: the same task but with a 4s delay between the end of the last reward in the probe and the choice (Fig. 6B). We found two effects of delay on preference. First, adding a delay decreased overall preferences for the probe sequence. Second, and more relevant to our hypothesis, monkeys showed a significant preference for the peaked sequence over the other two (bootstrap t-test, p =0.001 for the group of animals, and p <0.05 for each animal individually). We observed no difference between preference for [23532] and [24442] for either the group or the individuals (p =0.84 for the group and p >0.05 for each individual). These results endorse the memory hypothesis of peak preferences, and suggest that peak- and trend- preferences may be experimentally dissociable. 4 Discussion We used a novel decision-making task to study how monkeys evaluate sequences of rewards. We found that monkeys place more weight on items that occur later in a sequence. These results mirror similar human results showing biases for increasing sequences, and, like them, challenge the validity of simple discounting models of intertemporal choice (Frederick, Loewenstein, & O’Donoghue, 2002; Prelec & Loewenstein, 1991). Models of discounting indicate that monkeys devalue future rewards quite steeply and predict, in direct opposition to our data, that monkeys should strongly prefer decreasing sequences (Glimcher et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008). These contradictory findings are unlikely to reflect individual differences in our monkeys as they, like most monkeys, exhibit steep discounting as measured in standard intertemporal choice tasks (Blanchard et al., 2013). Our data also indicate that monkeys prefer sequences with prominent peak values, at least when working memory is challenged. We know of no study in humans or animals investigating the effects of working memory challenge on peak preferences. Together, these findings open the window to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms causing the peak bias. One earlier study examined the sequence preference patterns of rhesus monkeys (Xu et al., 2011). The major finding of this study was that monkeys preferred decreasing sequences of rewards, a finding that is directly opposite of what we report here. We suspect the difference between studies is due to factors of task design. Perhaps the largest difference is the number of trials. That study used 30 trials per day across three days for each of three monkey subjects in the critical experiment (with an additional 10 familiarization trials), whereas we used at least 1000 training trials before we began collecting data. It is possible that monkeys in that study failed to appreciate that choice of the smaller reward would lead to a larger reward later and thus used a larger-sooner heuristic that would have extinguished with more training. Indeed, we regularly observe random or biased preferences during the first hundred or so trials of training of all our tasks, and renewed biases for the first few dozen trials each day. Consistent with this idea, the authors of that study performed four control experiments and found somewhat inconsistent results (effects in only two of the three monkeys, twice significant in the opposite direction in the third monkey) in all of them. For example, experiment 4 in that study, which sought to replicate Experiment 1 with different rewards, found an end bias in one of the three subjects. Moreover, Experiments 2 and 3, which asked subjects to choose between pairs and singletons showed that one of the monkeys (different monkeys in 2 and 3) did not prefer the pair, suggesting a possible failure to understand the task. Various other differences in the studies may have helped to produce these different results. For example, it is possible that the use of a repetition design and the use of five rewards instead of two led to a larger working memory demand, and this elicited the bias (which some have suggested is linked to memory; Fredrickson & Kahneman, 1993). Their task also included a greater inter-reward interval (4s vs 0.5s), which may have made the causal relationship between the rewards more difficult to learn. They also used rewards that differed in quality (and thus along multiple dimensions simultaneously) instead of quantity, which also may have made the task more difficult to learn. Finally, as our task was automated and had a much greater number of trials, monkeys may have perceived the task environment as more stable than they did in the Xu study. As perceived stability of the environment can influence temporal preferences in other contexts (e.g. Kidd, Palmeri, & Aslin, 2013), it is plausible that the biases we observe are sensitive to perceptions of environmental stability. It is notable that the design of the Xu et al. is much more similar to that of a standard intertemporal choice task, and that their results are consistent with delay discounting experiments. 4.1 General Implications Our results show that, like humans, monkeys prefer sequences with increasing values. Are the human and monkey biases due to a common cause, or are the two facts coincidental? Our data cannot answer this question definitively. Indeed, human sequence preference effects, which are as diverse as they are ubiquitous, cannot be assigned to the same causes with any certainty. For example, most people prefer that their salary increase over their lifetime (a preference that is not wealth maximizing) and also prefer unpleasant noise bursts that diminish rather than grow over the timescale of seconds to minutes (Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993). These preferences may stem from a single cause or may reflect differing impulses with common results. Thus, we do not have a great understanding of the reasons for human preferences for increasing sequences. We therefore think it premature to argue that monkey peak-end rule biases are the same as those observed in humans, but instead simply that this class of preferences should added to the list of heretofore human-specific biases. This does not mean we are entirely blind to the cognitive factors that influence sequence biases in our task. In the case of the present study, two factors appear to be particularly important. First, our results suggest that excessive focus on more recent rewards (even on the timescale of seconds) may cause monkeys to integrate past rewards in a biased manner. Second, it appears that working memory capacity may be a critical limiting factor that causes this bias. Note that because working memory is limited to a few minutes, it is unlikely to account for biases in retrospective evaluations of, say, hour-long colonoscopies six months in the past (Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996). If these possibilities are borne out by subsequent studies, it would suggest that the key factor motivating choices in this task is not a basic preference for increasing sequences, but a perceptual/learning bias coupled with a preference for larger sequences. To the extent that they support this idea, the present results contribute to an emerging picture of animals as canny decision makers that seek to optimize but have specific bounds to their ability to choose utility maximizing options (Bateson & Kacelnik, 1996; Blanchard et al., 2013; Gigerenzer, 2002; Simon, 1955; Stephens, 2002; Stephens & Anderson, 2001). An important debate in the literature on preferences for sequences is whether we prefer increasing sequences or sequences with large end values. Although the peak-end rule favoured by Kahneman and his colleagues is the best known and most widely cited account for such judgments and choices, competing views have been repeatedly expressed, most notably by Ariely and his colleagues, who stress that the slope or rate-of-change in addition of other factors is the key determinant of preferences (Ariely, Kahneman, & Loewenstein, 2000). In particular, in a comprehensive analysis of the possible underlying determinants of retrospective pain evaluations, Ariely (1998) showed that importance of the pattern of experience including the direction of change, the gradient of the slope, and the final intensity. His conclusion was that the direction of change (trend), not the peak-end, in pain intensity is the single best predictor of retrospective evaluations (for similar evidence in the domain of satisfaction see Hsee & Abelson, 1991; Hsee et al., 1991). However, there remains a debate about the relative contribution of trend (defined as direction of change – worsening vs. improving) and the end specifically as determinants of preferences. We feel this to be fuelled in part by the flexibility of the peak-end rule – it describes a tendency for respondents to be influenced primarily by these two characteristics (peak intensity and end intensity), but does not specify that they must be weighed equally (indeed, there have been reported examples of cases in which the end was more important, and examples in which the peak was more important, as in Fredrickson, 2000, p. 588). In line with previous work, our data are more consistent with preferences for improving sequences (Loewenstein & Prelec, 1993), because: (1) the greatest increment to preference occurs when the most valued element of the sequencemovesfrom the first to the second position; (2) moving the most valued element to the end has no special effect (and a weaker effect if anything) than moving it later at some other point in the sequence (i.e., this is evidence against an specific ‘end effect’); (3) we detect a peak effect only with a memory challenge. Another way of looking at our results is to consider the similarities between sequences of rewards and multidimensional rewards. It is well-established that humans have difficulty integrating different dimensions of options to calculate a single utility value (Tversky, 1972). Instead, we generally use heuristic shortcuts, prioritizing certain dimensions (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982). In our task, each step in the sequence is independent and thus in some ways a different dimension. Here we find that monkeys prioritize the more recent rewards in evaluating sequences of options, suggesting that they, like humans, prioritize certain dimensions, perhaps to reduce cognitive load. As far as we are aware, monkeys’ proclivity for dimensional prioritization in standard multi-attribute choice tasks remains unstudied. 4.2 Challenge to temporal discounting models Animal psychologists have long used delay discounting tasks to investigate intertemporal preferences (Ainslie, 1975; Green, Fristoe, & Myerson, 1994; Mazur, 1987; McDiarmid & Rilling, 1965; Rachlin, 2004). It has been repeatedly shown that animals prefer smaller sooner rewards to larger later ones, and that preferences can be described by a hyperbolic (or sometimes exponential) decay curve (Kim et al., 2008; Mazur, 1987). Typically, animals are found to discount half of a reward’s value in 1–5s (Stephens & Anderson, 2001). These results apply across multiple taxa, including rhesus monkeys, apes, pigeons, rats and even guppies (Mühlhoff, Stevens, & Reader, 2011; Rosati, Stevens, Hare, & Hauser, 2007). The results of the present study cannot be explained using discounting approaches. Monkeys’ preferences for increasing sequences would require negative discount factors, which have never been observed in the animal kingdom. This possibility is unlikely because our monkeys exhibit garden-variety positive discount factors as measured by standard intertemporal choice tasks (Blanchard et al., 2013). Negative discount factors would also make no evolutionary sense because they would lead to a preference for infinite waiting. We see three possible interpretations for this discrepancy between intertemporal choice preferences and sequence preferences. First, monkeys may discount strongly in our reward repeat task, but other factors may outweigh the steep discounting. If so, this would suggest that discounting can be easily outweighed and counteracted by other psychological biases, and would challenge its generality and thus its utility as a metric for preferences (Pearson et al., 2010). Second, monkeys’ steep discounting may be limited to certain contexts, such as the intertemporal choice task including single outcomes, and lack predictive validity in other contexts (Stephens & Anderson, 2001). Third, specific design factors in intertemporal choice tasks may provide a misleadingly large reading of animals true discount factors, and animals do not actually discount rewards substantially on the order of seconds. We favor the third explanation. We and others have previously argued that animals exhibit a bound on their ability to process post-reward delays in delay discounting tasks, and this bound may explain the apparent extreme discounting values often found using these tasks (Blanchard et al., 2013; Pearson et al., 2010; Stephens, 2002). Moreover, animals fail to show steep discounting in naturalistic foraging-like tasks, challenging the validity of intertemporal choice measures (Stephens & Anderson, 2001; Stevens & Stephens, 2008). The present study, which unlike intertemporal choice tasks uses an experiential cue, will necessarily reduce any ambiguity about post-reward delays, and thus provides additional evidence that discount factors lack external validity. 4.3 Future directions The present results raise several important questions. How general are the patterns we observe here? Are they fully explainable due to limited memory or are other effects important? How similar are they do the effects observed in humans? What factors cause these biases and what factors cause the reverse? Do working memory effects in our task relate to putative long-term memory effects in similar tasks with longer delays? We only tested for end-biases with a short delay (0.5s) between the initial probe presentation and choice, but it is possible that a longer one may elicit a different pattern of biases. Indeed, different delay lengths have been found to affect recall biases in animal working memory tasks (Wright, Santiago, & Sands, 1984). Future work could investigate if this pattern holds true in preference tasks such as ours as well. It remains unclear whether these results will extend to more complex types of rewards, such as intrinsically rewarding sensory cues (Blatter & Schultz, 2006; Deaner, Khera, & Platt, 2005; Watson & Platt, 2012) or longer-duration experiences. Finally, we are curious to know what neural processes lead to these particular patterns of preferences for rewards.

Appendix A Basic methods In each session, the animal was transported from the colony at the University of Rochester to the testing room, about 100 feet away in the same building. The testing room was built specifically for primate studies and houses a computer screen and floor plate for firm mounting of the ergonomically designed primate chair (Crist). Animals made all task-relevant decisions using gaze shifts to selected targets. Horizontal and vertical eye positions were sampled at 1000Hz by an infrared eye-monitoring camera system (SR Research, Osgoode, ON). Stimuli were controlled by a computer running Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) with Psychtoolbox (Brainard, 1997) and Eyelink Toolbox (Cornelissen, Peters, & Palmer, 2002). A standard solenoid valve controlled the duration of water delivery (Parker). We measured fluid volumes associated with solenoid open time in order to ensure that fluid amounts were linearly proportional to the values instructed by the program. We confirmed that water delivery volume was constant regardless of the volume of water in the reservoir over the ranges used in this experiment. Fluid access was controlled outside of experimental sessions. References Ainslie, 1975 G.

The left-hand panel represents frequency-manipulated stimuli, the central panel represents predictability-manipulated stimuli, and the right-hand panel represents filler stimuli (normal control words in the reading tasks, nonword spelling errors during the proofreading task in Experiment 1, and wrong word spelling errors in Experiment 2). Data for the reading task represent the average for a given condition across the two experiments. Fig. 2 Total time on target words across the two experiments, separated by stimulus type. The left-hand panel represents frequency-manipulated stimuli, the central panel represents predictability-manipulated stimuli, and the right-hand panel represents filler stimuli (normal control words in the reading tasks, nonword spelling errors during the proofreading task in Experiment 1, and wrong word spelling errors in Experiment 2). Data for the reading task represent the average for a given condition across the two experiments. Table 1 Framework of some processes involved in normal reading and our hypotheses about how they change when proofreading for the two types of errors involved in Experiment 1 (nonwords) and Experiment 2 (wrong words). Check marks in the reading column show that these processes are engaged and check marks for the proofreading columns show these processes are unchanged relative to normal reading. Arrows show relative increases or decreases in the importance of (and thus amount of predicted reader engagement with) each component process relative to normal reading. Multiple entries in a single cell indicate multiple possibilities as to how a component process will be modulated in the particular type of proofreading as compared with normal reading.

Filler items, frequency items and predictability items were each counterbalanced across task and subject. For filler items, in the reading block only the error-free control word version was seen whereas in the proofreading block the nonword error was seen in Experiment 1 and the wrong word error was seen in Experiment 2. Target words are presented in italics. Stimulus set Task Target word Sentence Filler Reading Control The runners trained for the marathon on the track behind the high school. Proof reading Error in Experiment 1 The runners trained for the marathon on the trcak behind the high school. Error in Experiment 2 The runners trained for the marathon on the trial behind the high school. Frequency Reading and proofreading High frequency The inner components are protected by a black metal increasing its lifespan. Low frequency The inner components are protected by a black alloy increasing its lifespan. Predictability Reading and proofreading High predictability The skilled gardener went outside to pull up the weeds along the driveway. Low predictability The skilled gardener went outside to pull up the roses along the driveway. Table 3 Mean proofreading accuracy as a function of stimulus set in Experiments 1 and 2. Frequency and predictability stimuli accuracy constitutes correct rejections (i.e., correctly identifying that there is no error) and error stimuli accuracy constitutes hits (i.e., correctly identifying that there is an error). The d′ measure is calculated from the hit rate and the false alarm rate (1-correct rejections).

Highlights • Subjects read for comprehension (block 1) then proofread for typos (block 2). • Typos resulted in nonwords (e.g., trcak for track) in E1, or wrong words (e.g., trial for trail) in E2. • Frequency effects in error-free sentences increased in proofreading compared to reading in both experiments. • Predictability effects only increased in total reading time in Experiment 2 (checking for wrong words). • A theoretical framework to understand component processes of reading compared to our proofreading tasks is discussed. Abstract It is well-known that word frequency and predictability affect processing time. These effects change magnitude across tasks, but studies testing this use tasks with different response types (e.g., lexical decision, naming, and fixation time during reading; Schilling, Rayner, & Chumbley, 1998), preventing direct comparison. Recently, Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010) overcame this problem, comparing fixation times in reading for comprehension and proofreading, showing that the frequency effect was larger in proofreading than in reading. This result could be explained by readers exhibiting substantial cognitive flexibility, and qualitatively changing how they process words in the proofreading task in a way that magnifies effects of word frequency. Alternatively, readers may not change word processing so dramatically, and instead may perform more careful identification generally, increasing the magnitude of many word processing effects (e.g., both frequency and predictability). We tested these possibilities with two experiments: subjects read for comprehension and then proofread for spelling errors (letter transpositions) that produce nonwords (e.g., trcak for track as in Kaakinen & Hyönä) or that produce real but unintended words (e.g., trial for trail) to compare how the task changes these effects. Replicating Kaakinen and Hyönä, frequency effects increased during proofreading. However, predictability effects only increased when integration with the sentence context was necessary to detect errors (i.e., when spelling errors produced words that were inappropriate in the sentence; trial for trail). The results suggest that readers adopt sophisticated word processing strategies to accommodate task demands. Keywords Reading Eye movements Task effects Frequency Predictability 1 Introduction The processing of a word in a sentence is affected by a range of linguistic properties, across many tasks and experimental paradigms, but how does the cognitive system change the way it responds to these properties in different tasks? Two hallmark effects derive from the frequency of a word to be processed (high frequency words are processed more quickly than low frequency words) and the predictability of a word in its sentence context (more predictable words are processed more quickly than less predictable words; see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Rayner, 1998, 2009 for reviews). While frequency and predictability effects are robust and well documented, the magnitudes of these effects vary across tasks and paradigms (even when equating the magnitude of the frequency or predictability manipulation). The fact that these effects change across tasks suggests that the way in which people approach a task can modulate the extent to which they are sensitive to specific linguistic properties of the words they read (even when held constant across tasks). In the present study, we investigated this cognitive flexibility in reading for comprehension and proofreading. While still poorly understood, proofreading is a useful task for elucidating how cognitive processing changes along with task demands because of its similarity to reading for comprehension in terms of stimuli and response measure. The only differences in experimental design between these two tasks are the instructions and the inclusion of sentences that contain an error. Thus, we can study how processing of sentences without errors changes when people are asked to process them in different ways: checking for errors or reading for understanding. In the remainder of this introduction, we briefly discuss frequency effects and predictability effects and existing evidence regarding how they change magnitude across tasks, then turn to theoretical and empirical aspects of proofreading and discuss the goals and design of the present study. 1.1 Frequency effects Word frequency is one of the strongest linguistic aspects of a word that affects how easily it is processed, across many tasks (lexical decision, Stanners, Jastrzembski, & Westbrook, 1975; word naming, Berry, 1971; Forster & Chambers, 1973; reading a sentence, as indexed by eye fixation times, Inhoff & Rayner, 1986; Rayner & Duffy, 1986; see Rayner, 1998, 2009 for reviews; and event related potentials, King & Kutas, 1998; Polich & Donchin, 1988; see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011 for a review). In general, cross-experiment comparisons cannot convincingly test whether frequency effects change size across tasks because they use different stimuli (the magnitude of the effect on the response variable depends on the magnitude of the frequency manipulation) and different subjects (more skilled readers show smaller frequency effects than average readers; Ashby, Rayner, & Clifton, 2005). The most direct indication that frequency effects change across tasks comes from studies by Schilling, Rayner, and Chumbley (1998; for a more recent similar study, see Kuperman, Drieghe, Keuleers, & Brysbaert, 2013) and Rayner and Raney (1996; see also Rayner & Fischer, 1996, as well as Murray & Forster, 2008). Schilling et al. used the same materials and subjects and compared frequency effects between word naming, lexical decision, and gaze duration 1 Schilling et al. (1998) also analyzed first fixation duration and single fixation duration. 1 (how long the eyes remain on a word before leaving it) during reading. The sizes of the frequency effect on naming latencies, lexical decision latencies, and gaze durations were highly correlated (though Kuperman et al. (2013) reported generally lower correlations), but more importantly, were not equal across tasks (64ms in naming, 149ms in lexical decision, and 67ms in gaze durations during reading). These tasks differ in the type of processing required (Schilling et al., 1998): naming emphasizes producing the sounds of the word (although this can be greatly facilitated by lexical and semantic access), lexical decision emphasizes how familiar the word is (Gernsbacher, 1984; which is highly related to word frequency), and reading emphasizes accessing the meaning of the word (but obviously involves processing the word’s sounds and familiarity, as well). Rayner and Raney (1996); see also Rayner & Fischer, 1996) found that the frequency effect (which was 53ms when subjects read for comprehension) went away (i.e., was only 1ms) when subjects searched for a particular word in a passage (and responded when they had found it). Rayner and Raney suggested that reading for comprehension requires accessing meaning (dependent on lexical access) and searching for a word in a text can be performed by more surface-level matching and may not be sensitive to frequency. In a similar vein, during mindless reading (e.g., when the reader “zones out” and stops understanding the sentence but their eyes continue to move along the text) frequency effects are absent (Reichle, Rennenberg, & Schooler, 2010) or attenuated (Schad & Engbert, 2012). Taken together, data on frequency effects across tasks suggest that when word identification does not occur (either because it is not necessary, as in word search, or shuts off, as in mindless reading) subjects are insensitive or minimally sensitive to word frequency, whereas when word identification is required or emphasized (as in reading and lexical decision) frequency influences how long it takes to do so, although the precise way in which it does so in these cases also depends on the particular requirements of the task. 1.2 Predictability effects When a word is encountered in a sentence (as opposed to in isolation) the meaning of the other words in the sentence can help constrain and identify the target word. In fact, the predictability of a word (i.e., how expected the word is, given the prior context) has an effect on reading times and fixation probabilities (Balota, Pollatsek, & Rayner, 1985; Drieghe, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2005; Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Kliegl, Grabner, Rolfs, & Engbert, 2004; Rayner, Slattery, Drieghe, & Liversedge, 2011; Rayner & Well, 1996; Zola, 1984; see Rayner, 1998, 2009 for reviews) as well as ERPs (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984; see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011 for a review). Tests for predictability effects in isolated word processing tasks are rare. However, some studies have recorded response times to target words presented after a sentence context (in word naming: Stanovich & West, 1979, 1981; West & Stanovich, 1982; and lexical decision: Schuberth & Eimas, 1977) or when the target word is preceded by a single prime word (in naming: de Groot, 1985; Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971; and lexical decision: Schuberth & Eimas, 1977). Here, cross task comparisons reveal that the predictability effect for primed lexical decision (65ms) is larger than for primed naming (38ms; de Groot, 1985; cf. West & Stanovich, 1982), but these have not been directly compared to eye fixations in reading using the same materials and the same subjects. Therefore, as with frequency effects, discussed in Section 1.1, the degree to which subjects respond to inter-word information (i.e., predictability, or the target word’s fit into the sentence context) is also modulated by the type of processing the task requires. 1.3 Proofreading While the above studies suggest that frequency and predictability effects change across tasks, they are not the most direct test of such changes because the different tasks used (lexical decision, naming, reading) elicit different types of responses (e.g., button presses, vocal responses, eye fixation times, and EEG). Thus, comparisons between tasks, such as Schilling et al. (1998; de Groot, 1985; Kuperman et al., 2013; West & Stanovich, 1982) are suggestive of, but not conclusive about, how different tasks affect word processing, particularly with respect to how word properties are emphasized. Therefore, we turn to a pair of tasks that can utilize the same stimuli, subjects, and response measures: reading for comprehension and proofreading. Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010) did just this: they compared frequency effects while subjects were reading sentences for comprehension vs. proofreading for spelling errors. We will return to Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010) shortly. First, however, we discuss possible task differences introduced by proofreading, introduce a framework within which to understand and predict these task differences, and discuss previous studies investigating proofreading. Unlike in ordinary reading, where the reader’s goal is to generally apprehend the meaning of the text, in proofreading the goal of the proofreader is to search the text, identify errors (such as omissions, additions, and replacements), and (in some cases) potentially determine how the text should be changed in order to eliminate those errors while preserving (or restoring) what the proofreader infers to be the intended meaning of the text. At an intuitive level, it is plausible that there may be substantial differences in the linguistic processing performed during proofreading as compared with ordinary reading since the goals of the two tasks are substantially different: in particular, whereas in ordinary reading errors can generally be ignored so long as they do not interfere with apprehension of the text’s intended meaning, in proofreading these errors are the focus of the task. The errors existing in a text to be proofread can come in various forms: spelling errors, grammatical errors, semantic violations, etc. Most studies (including our present research) focus on misspellings, for which the error is localized to a specific word. Perhaps the most easily detectable of these errors are those that produce nonwords (nonword errors; e.g., trcak for track). Detection of these errors requires only the assessment of word status (i.e., whether the letter string is a known word; Daneman & Stainton, 1993; Levy, Newell, Snyder, & Timmins, 1986), and they can sometimes be identified from the surface features of the word alone (i.e., determining if the letter string follows orthographic rules of the language or can yield pronounceable output). Proofreading for these nonword (surface level) errors may be easiest because the proofreader need only check orthographic legality and/or word status and then stop (i.e., not try to integrate an error into the sentence). Thus, in these situations, linguistic processing beyond orthographic checking and basic word recognition may be reduced compared with what occurs in ordinary reading. More subtle (and consequently less easily detected) errors are those that constitute real words (wrong word errors; e.g., replacing an intended word trail with trial) because these words would pass a cursory assessment of orthographic legality or word status. Consequently, to detect these types of errors, proofreaders may need to perform deeper processing than for nonword errors: they must know not only that a letter string is a word, but also what word it is, what its syntactic and semantic properties are, and whether some other word would have been appropriate instead, in order to decide whether it is an incorrect word. Note in particular that proofreading for wrong word errors thus generally requires not only checking the word itself, but also assessing the degree to which the word’s meaning and grammatical properties are appropriate for the context, which requires integration of information across multiple words. Consequently, these errors should be different in at least two respects from nonword errors: (1) they should be more difficult to detect because they require processing at multiple levels (i.e., checking orthographic legality, determining word status, and checking inter-word compatibility); and (2) proofreading for wrong-word errors should involve less reduction of deeper linguistic processing (both lexical and sentence level). 1.3.1 Theoretical framework With these considerations in mind, we now lay out a theoretical framework within which potential differences between various “reading” tasks, including normal reading for comprehension, proofreading to catch nonwords, and proofreading to catch wrong words, can be understood. This framework is agnostic as to the specific model of eye movement control in reading (e.g., Bicknell & Levy, 2010; Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998; Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003; Schad & Engbert, 2012) assumed, although it should be noted that any complete model of reading must ultimately be able to account for task differences in reading behavior. Our starting desideratum is that any type of reading—be it normal reading, scanning (skimming the text to find keywords), or proofreading—must involve some combination of (1) identifying words and (2) combining the meanings of those identified words to recover sentence meaning. Each of (1) and (2) can be further broken into different components (Table 1 ). Word identification involves both recognition of word-form and access of lexical content. Word-form recognition can involve both decisions about whether or not the letter string is a word and, furthermore, what exact word it is. For example, wordhood assessment, which we define as recognizing whether the letter string has a legal (known) orthographic entry (similar to the “orthographic checking” process hypothesized by Kaakinen & Hyönä, 2010) is most obviously relevant for proofreading, but is also relevant even for normal reading since the reader must be able to deal with novel words. We define form validation, on the other hand, as recognizing the specific sequence of letters constituting the word currently being read. Wordhood assessment and form validation are logically distinct. A reader may, for example, conclude that an incompletely identified letter string such as “qo###” is not a word (wordhood assessment without complete form validation), and may also correctly identify the exact letter sequence of a word such as “aortas” while failing to successfully match the sequence to an entry in his/her mental lexicon (correct form validation but incorrect wordhood assessment). Content access involves retrieving word meaning and grammatical properties. Sentence-level processing includes combining individual words’ content into larger, phrasal units (integration) and also assessment of whether each individual word is compatible with the rest of the sentence (word-context validation; essential for many types of error correction). We assume that there is flexibility in the degree to which each of these component processes is engaged during reading and that there is some cognitive resource cost (perhaps minimal, perhaps not) associated with each such process. We further propose that readers adaptively shift the degree of engagement of each process so as to efficiently meet task goals (for further discussion see Section 1.4) without expenditure of undue amounts of cognitive resources (Table 1). It seems clear that all five of the above processes are relevant and have resources devoted to them during normal reading (hence the check marks in those cells in Table 1); we now turn to how, in different types of proofreading, they may differ in importance relative to normal reading. When proofreading for errors that produce nonwords, the most obvious change is that both processes related to surface form—wordhood assessment and form validation—increase in importance (hence the up arrows in those cells in Table 1). It is unlikely, on the other hand, that these proofreaders would need to access content, integrate that content across words, or expend resources on word-context validation as thoroughly as during normal reading, because errors could be detected based almost exclusively on surface features and engaging in these processes might unnecessarily slow the proofreader down. Nevertheless, if accessing content and performing sentence-level processing are not costly, it is possible that these processes would not be de-emphasized, since sentence-level context makes reading more efficient overall (Bicknell & Levy, 2012; Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Morton, 1964; Rayner & Well, 1996). Thus, we predict that during proofreading for nonwords these processes would be either unchanged (represented by check marks) or de-emphasized (represented by down arrows) as compared with normal reading. Proofreading for errors that produce wrong words, in contrast, would lead to a different prioritization of component processes: fit into sentence context rather than surface features of words is the critical indicator of error status. This task would de-emphasize (or leave unaffected) wordhood assessment, since wrong words still match to lexical entries, but more heavily emphasize form validation and content access (essential, for example, to identify an erroneous instance of trial that should have been trail, or vice versa). This task would also more heavily emphasize word-context validation. However, it is unclear how sentence-level integration would be affected by proofreading for wrong words in comparison with normal reading (and so all three possibilities are represented): it might be enhanced by the need to perform effective word-context validation, it might be reduced since the depth of interpretation required for successful normal reading may not be necessary or worthwhile for adequate proofreading for wrong words, or it could remain unchanged. Now let us consider how the two linguistic properties we focus on in the present study—frequency and predictability—are likely to be implicated in the processes we have described above, and the implications for how the two types of proofreading tasks may modulate the effects of these variables on eye movement behavior. Within word identification, increased emphasis on form validation is likely to slow the process overall during proofreading, so that readers obtain better input regarding word form, but is unlikely to modulate frequency or predictability effects, since visual input is ultimately the sole arbiter of the form of a string. Wordhood assessment and content access together are likely to implicate both frequency and predictability: frequent words may be easier to recognize as valid strings and to retrieve content for, and predictability effects reflect readers’ anticipation of upcoming meanings and word forms. Wordhood assessment and content access need to occur when a word is first encountered in order for understanding to proceed, hence their effects should not exclusively show up on late eye movement measures, but rather should appear during first pass reading. In sentence-level processing, however, predictability, which reflects degree of contextual fit, is likely to be far more important than frequency: words with higher predictability are likely to be easier to integrate syntactically (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and semantically (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984), and easier to validate as being a valid word, given the context and the visual input (Levy, Bicknell, Slattery, & Rayner, 2009). Our framework leaves open a number of possibilities, but it also makes three clear predictions: (1) overall speed is likely to be slower in proofreading than in normal reading provided that errors are reasonably difficult to spot and subjects proofread to a high degree of accuracy; (2) effects of proofreading for nonwords should show up (at least) in early eye-movement measures; and (3) predictability effects are more likely to be magnified in proofreading for wrong words than in proofreading for nonwords. We now turn to prior research on proofreading. 1.3.2 Existing data on proofreading Existing data on proofreading are consistent with the above account, but are far from conclusive. Most studies of proofreading involve long passages and require subjects to circle, cross out, or indicate an error some way on-line during sentence reading. The major focus of these studies is whether certain types of errors are detected, indicating the success or failure of the process, but not how it is achieved. Additionally, to avoid ceiling effects in error detection, subjects in these studies were generally told to emphasize speed, potentially de-emphasizing some of the processes that would otherwise be involved in the proofreading task (as predicted by the framework described above). From these studies, it is clear that the ability to detect spelling errors that are a result of letter substitutions or transpositions that produce nonwords (e.g., exict or exsit for exist; Healy, 1980, 1981; Holbrook, 1978a, 1978b) is fairly good, but depends on the similarity between wrong letters and intended letters (i.e., surface features of the word, relating to our hypothesized process of wordhood assessment). Furthermore, subjects are better able to detect nonword errors when the intended word is low frequency (e.g., sleat for sleet) than when it is high frequency (e.g., grean for green; Van Orden, 1991; see also Holbrook, 1978b; Jared, Levy, & Rayner, 1999), suggesting that subjects are more likely to coerce an errorful letter string into a real word if it is similar to a high frequency word (wordhood assessment and form validation may have been rushed and performed too cursorily). Less detectable are wrong word errors (Daneman & Stainton, 1993; Levy et al., 1986), which moreover show differences in the contribution of phonological similarity to the intended word: homophone substitutions (e.g., mail for male) are less detectable than spelling control substitutions (e.g., mile; Banks, Oka, & Shugarman, 1981; Jared et al., 1999), potentially implicating that phonological status may mediate content access. Perhaps in addition, it may be the case that spelling uncertainty, which coincides with homophony, mediates content access. The proofreading studies mentioned above generally focused on detection of errors, in terms of accuracy and detection time and can only tell us about whether or not proofreading was successful, not about how it modulated fundamental component processes of reading. A deeper understanding of this latter issue requires investigating how the reading of error-free words and sentences is affected by the instructions to look for errors. The most direct assessment of this comes from the aforementioned study by Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010). They had native Finnish speakers perform two tasks with Finnish sentences: first, they read sentences for comprehension, answering occasional comprehension questions; then, they performed a proofreading task, in which they checked for misspellings of words that produced nonwords. They analyzed reading measures on sentences that did not contain errors, but did contain a frequency manipulation (as well as a length manipulation), finding an interaction between the frequency effect and task: frequency effects for gaze durations were larger in proofreading (141ms for long words and 79ms for short words) than in reading for comprehension (81ms for long words and 30ms for short words). They concluded that their task emphasized orthographic checking, which depends on word frequency (i.e., can be done faster when the word is more familiar). There are two possible interpretations of Kaakinen and Hyönä’s (2010) results. One is that, as suggested by Kaakinen and Hyönä, word processing works qualitatively differently in proofreading than in reading for comprehension. This account implies that readers can flexibly change how they read in response to task demands. That is, they perform task-sensitive word processing that leads to frequency information playing a larger role than in typical word identification when proofreading for nonwords, but other properties (i.e., predictability) might remain unchanged (because frequency would be sufficient for detecting errors). This account is consistent with the theoretical framework we laid out above. It is also possible, however, that readers may have less ability to selectively change the way they process words in response to task demands. Instead, proofreading could work in a qualitatively similar way as reading for comprehension but demand that subjects become more confident than usual in word identities (to rule out visually similar nonword neighbors). Thus, subjects would take advantage of all sources of information that would help them discern the identity of the word (e.g., the predictability of the word or its fit into the sentence context). Under this more cautious reading account, the amplification of the frequency effect in proofreading is just a result of the longer processing time required for higher confidence (e.g., the size of the effects may grow with increasing reading times) and we would expect to see similar changes in predictability effects in response to changes in task. This account would be inconsistent with the theoretical framework we laid out above, which predicts that subcomponent processes are differentially modulated by proofreading in general. Thus, the task-sensitive word processing account predicts that proofreading for wrong words would amplify predictability effects whereas proofreading for nonwords would not. The more cautious reading account, on the other hand, predicts that predictability effects would be amplified across the board by proofreading, regardless of the type of proofreading task. Thus, finding differential effects of word predictability as a function of type of proofreading task would support the task-sensitive word processing account, and would imply that readers exhibit substantial cognitive flexibility in adapting reading behavior to task demands. On the other hand, if predictability effects increase in proofreading for both wrong word and nonword errors, it would lend support to the more cautious reading account and suggest that readers change how they process words in response to task demands in a global, less sophisticated way. 1.4 Goals of the present study In the present study, we thus had three main goals. The first goal was to confirm the results of Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010) that frequency effects on non-error trials increase in proofreading for nonwords in another language (English). The second goal was to tease apart the task-sensitive word processing and more cautious reading accounts by determining whether predictability effects increase in the same way as frequency effects when subjects are proofreading for nonword errors. These first two goals are tested in Experiment 1. The third goal was to compare how different types of proofreading tasks change these effects (i.e., checking for nonwords like trcak for track in Experiment 1 vs. checking for wrong words like trial for trail in Experiment 2) and to compare those results against the predictions of the theoretical framework described in Section 1.3.1. In each experiment, we had subjects perform two tasks: reading for comprehension and then proofreading for spelling errors. Both tasks included sentences without errors that contained either a frequency or a predictability manipulation that we used to determine the extent to which subjects were sensitive to these word properties. In the first experiment, subjects checked for spelling errors that produced nonwords (e.g., trcak instead of track), similar to the subjects in Kaakinen and Hyönä’s (2010) experiment. 2 Experiment 1 2.1 Method 2.1.1 Subjects Forty-eight members of the University of California, San Diego community participated in the experiment for course credit, or monetary compensation ($10.00). Subjects were native English speakers who were unaware of the purpose of this experiment. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision with glasses or soft contacts. In this experiment, as in Experiment 2, the subjects ranged in age from 18 to 25years old. 2.1.2 Apparatus Eye movement data were recorded via an SR Research Ltd. Eyelink 1000 eye tracker in tower setup that restrains head movements with forehead and chin rests. Viewing of the monitor was binocular, but only the movements of the right eye were recorded, at a sampling frequency of 1000Hz. Subjects were seated approximately 60cm away from a 20-in. NEC MultiSync FP 1370 CRT monitor with a screen resolution of 1024×768pixels and a refresh rate of 150Hz. The sentences were presented in the center of the screen with black Courier New 14-point font on a white background and were always presented in one line of text with 3.8 characters subtending 1 degree of visual angle. Following calibration, eye position errors were less than 0.3°. Subjects’ responses were recorded with a Microsoft controller using a directional pad and triggers. 2.1.3 Materials and design The stimuli/materials were adopted from four published studies to create three sets of stimuli that were fully counterbalanced across subject and task in the experiments (see Table 2 ): filler items (error-free in the reading block and each item containing one error in the proofreading block; Appendix A), frequency items (high vs. low frequency; Appendix B), and predictability items (high vs. low predictability; Appendix C). Filler stimuli were 60 items taken from Johnson (2009), which investigated reading time on words that have a transposition letter neighbor (e.g., trail, which has the transposition neighbor trial) and control words that were matched on length, frequency, number of orthographic neighbors, number of syllables and fit into the sentence, but did not have a transposition letter neighbor (e.g., track). For the reading block, the sentences with the control word without a transposition letter neighbor were presented (e.g., “The runners trained for the marathon on the track behind the high school.”). For the proofreading block, we adapted the target words to create error stimuli, introducing one word with a spelling error in these sentences. Error words were created by transposing two letters of the control words from Johnson (2009; e.g., track produced trcak; “The runners trained for the marathon on the trcak behind the high school.”). We matched the location of the letter transposition in these words to the location in the word with a transposition letter neighbor. For example, trail differs from trial in that the third and fourth letters are transposed so we transposed the third and fourth letters in track to produce trcak. There were three exceptions, in which the to-be-transposed letters were identical (i.e., eggs and cool) or constituted a real word (i.e., crab 2 The fact that this control word (crab) has a transposition letter neighbor (carb) was an error in Johnson’s (2009) stimuli. 2 which would produce carb), in which case we transposed the closest two non-initial letters (i.e., egsg, colo and crba). Frequency stimuli (which did not contain any errors) were 60 items taken from Drieghe, Rayner, and Pollatsek (2008; e.g., “The inner components are protected by a black metal/alloy increasing its lifespan.”); two items were slightly modified by changing or adding a word that was not the target. For the final set of items, target words were all five letters long; the high frequency words had a mean raw frequency of 94 per million (log frequency per million of 1.8 (SE=.05)) and low frequency words had a mean raw frequency of 7 per million (log frequency per million of 0.6 (SE=.06)), estimated from the British National Corpus (BNC, 2007). Predictability items (which also did not contain any errors) were taken from Rayner and Well (1996; 36 items) and Balota et al. (1985; 96 items; e.g., “The skilled gardener went outside to pull up the weeds/roses along the driveway.”). We made minor changes to six items to make the sentences more plausible in the low predictability condition. We performed two kinds of norming on this set: (1) cloze norming (N =36), and (2) fragment plausibility norming (N =50), in which subjects rated the plausibility of the fragment up to and including the critical words on a scale of 1–9. To ensure the strength of the predictability manipulation with our subjects, we excluded any items for which more than one subject gave the low predictability completion in cloze. To ensure that the stimuli were not taken to be errors in the proofreading task, however, we also excluded any item that had plausibility lower than 6 in either condition. For the final set of 60 items (12 from Rayner and Well and 48 from Balota et al.), the high predictability condition had a mean cloze score of 0.64 (SE=.02) and a plausibility rating of 7.8 (SE=.1), and the low predictability condition had a mean cloze score of 0.008 (SE=.002) and a plausibility rating of 7.1 (SE=.1). The two conditions did not significantly differ in terms of frequency of the target words (high predictability, M raw =46 (SE=9), M log =1.29 (SE=.08); low predictability, M raw =47 (SE=8), M log =1.32 (SE=.08), again, estimated from the BNC). The experimental sentences were broken up into two blocks: reading for comprehension and proofreading. Both the reading and proofreading blocks consisted of 30 frequency stimuli (15 high frequency, 15 low frequency), 30 predictability sentences (15 high predictability, 15 low predictability) and 30 items from Johnson (2009), which served as fillers in the reading block (none contained errors) and errors in the proofreading block. In the proofreading block, one third of the items (30 trials) contained errors. These groups of items were fully counterbalanced in a Latin square design. The sentence presentation for each condition was randomized. Sentences in the reading block did not contain any spelling errors. 2.1.4 Procedure At the start of the experiment, the eye-tracker was calibrated with a 3-point calibration scheme. Subjects started with the reading block and were told to read the sentences for comprehension and to respond to occasional comprehension questions. Subjects did so by pressing the left or right trigger on the Microsoft controller to answer yes or no, respectively. After each question, feedback was provided such that a correct answer would proceed to the next trial, whereas an incorrect response resulted in a screen presenting “INCORRECT!” for 3s before advancing to a the next trial. Subjects received three practice trials before the reading block. In the proofreading block, subjects were instructed to proofread each sentence for spelling errors and after each sentence were prompted to respond whether or not there was a spelling error. There was feedback in proofreading the same as in reading. Subjects were instructed to proofread “looking for spelling errors only.” At the beginning of this block, subjects received three practice trials (one of which had an error). Following Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010), the reading block was presented first to avoid carryover effects because starting with the proofreading block may have prompted subjects to continue proofreading in the reading block. Furthermore, subjects were unaware (during the reading block) that they would be proofreading in the experiment. Each trial began with a fixation point in the center of the screen, which the subject was required to fixate until the experimenter started the trial. Then a fixation box appeared on the left side of the screen, located at the start of the sentence. Once a fixation was detected in this box, it disappeared and the sentence appeared. The sentence was presented on the screen until the subject pressed a button signaling they completed reading the sentence. Subjects were instructed to look at a target sticker on the right side of the monitor beside the screen when they finished reading to prevent them from refixating a word as they pressed the button. In the reading block, the 30 filler sentences were followed by a comprehension question requiring a “yes” or “no” response with the corresponding triggers. In the proofreading block, every sentence was followed by a question asking, “Was there a spelling error?” After subjects finished proofreading each sentence they had to answer “yes” or “no” with the triggers. The experimental session lasted for approximately forty-five minutes to one hour. 2.2 Results and discussion Data were analyzed using inferential statistics based on generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs). In the LMMs, task (reading vs. proofreading), target type (predictability item vs. frequency item, where applicable), and independent variable value (high vs. low, where applicable, or filler (error-free in the reading block) vs. error (in the proofreading block), where applicable) were centered and entered as fixed effects, and subjects and items were entered as crossed random effects, including intercepts and slopes (see Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008), using the maximal random effects structure (Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013). For models that did not converge before reaching the iteration limit, we removed random effects that accounted for the least variance and did not significantly improve the model’s fit to the data iteratively until the model did converge. 3 The models for which this was necessary were: regressions out of the target in Experiment 1 frequency stimuli (we removed the correlation between the intercept and the other random effects structure for items) and predictability stimuli (we removed the correlation between the intercept and the other random effects structure for subjects), total time analyses for predictability items in Experiment 2 (we removed the correlation between the intercept and the other random effects structure for items). For the models of the three-way interactions only the random slopes of the three-way interaction were used. 3 In order to fit the LMMs, the lmer function from the lme4 package (Bates, Maechler, & Bolker, 2011) was used within the R Environment for Statistical Computing (R Development Core Team, 2009). For fixation duration measures, we used linear mixed-effects regression, and report regression coefficients (b), which estimate the effect size (in milliseconds) of the reported comparison, and the t-value of the effect coefficient. For binary dependent variables (accuracy and fixation probability data), we use logistic mixed-effects regression, and report regression coefficients (b), which represent effect size in log-odds space and the z value of the effect coefficient. Values of the t and z statistics greater than or equal to 1.96 indicate an effect that is significant at approximately the .05 level. 2.2.1 Question accuracy Mean accuracy and error detection ability for proofreading are reported in Table 3 . Overall, subjects performed very well both in the comprehension task (94% correct) and in the proofreading task (95% correct). 2.2.2 Eye movement measures Fixations shorter than 80ms were combined with a previous or subsequent fixation if they were within one character of each other or were eliminated. Trials in which there was a blink or track loss during first pass reading on the target word or during an immediately adjacent fixation were removed (1% of the original number of trials). For each fixation duration measure, durations greater than 2.5 standard deviations from the subject’s mean (calculated separately across tasks) were also removed (less than 2% of the data from any measure were removed by this procedure). The remaining data were evenly distributed across conditions. To assess the extent to which readers were sensitive to properties of specific words we analyzed reading measures on target words within the sentence. 4 In addition to the target word, we analyzed reading time measures on the pre-target (Appendix D) and post-target word (Appendix E). For the pre-target word, almost all measures showed an effect of task, with longer reading times when subjects were proofreading than when they were reading, reflecting the same pattern seen on the target and in global reading measures. For the main effects of frequency and predictability, significant effects only appeared for regressions into the pre-target word, suggesting that these effects were driven subjects directly reading the target word. For regressions into the pre-target word, frequency interacted with task but predictability did not in both Experiments. For the post-target word, there was a main effect of task for all measures in Experiment 2, but these effects were only significant for late measures in Experiment 1. There were no significant spillover effects of frequency for either Experiment. There was a significant spillover effect of predictability for regressions out of the post-target word in Experiment 1 and for all effects but gaze duration in Experiment 2. There were significant interactions between task and both of the manipulated variables for regressions out of the post-target word in Experiment 1. 4 We analyzed six standard fixation time measures (Rayner, 1998, 2009): first pass measures, such as probability of making a first-pass fixation, first fixation duration (the duration of the first fixation on the target, regardless of how many fixations are made), single fixation duration (the duration of a fixation on the target when only one fixation is made), gaze duration (the sum of the duration of all fixations made on the target before leaving it), as well as later measures, such as total viewing time (the sum of all fixations on the target, including rereading of it after first-pass reading) and go-past time (the sum of the duration of all fixations on the target and any rereading of words to the left of it until the target is passed to the right). In addition, we also analyzed the probability of regressing into the target and the probability of regressing out of the target. To assess how subjects approached the task of proofreading, we analyzed reading time measures on target words that did not contain an error (in either the reading or proofreading block) but did contain either a frequency (e.g., “The inner components are protected by a black metal/alloy increasing its lifespan.”) or predictability manipulation (e.g., “The skilled gardener went outside to pull up the weeds/roses along the driveway.”). We analyzed local reading measures on the target words presented in italics above (but not presented in italics in the experiment; means and standard errors are in Table 4 ). For the following analyses, task (reading vs. proofreading) and independent variable (high vs. low) were entered as fixed effects in the LMMs. The LMMs were fit separately for frequency items and predictability items (except for test of the three-way interaction, see Section 2.2.2.3). An interaction between independent variable (high vs. low frequency or high vs. low predictability) and task (reading vs. proofreading) would indicate that subjects were changing their sensitivity to these word properties in order to perform the task. 2.2.2.1 Fixation time measures Results of the linear mixed effects analyses on fixation time measures are reported in Table 5 . There was a significant effect of task for all fixation time measures for sentences with a frequency manipulation (single fixation duration: b =8.86, t =2.35; gaze duration: b =14.71, t =32.80; total time: b =34.25, t =4.63; go-past time: 34.79, t =4.77) with the exception of first fixation duration (b =4.26, t =1.13) and for sentences with a predictability manipulation (first fixation duration: b =12.17, t =3.79; single fixation duration: b =13.53, t =3.93; gaze duration: b =14.15, t =3.08; total time: b =28.02, t =3.68; go-past time: 17.97, t =2.57), indicating that, when checking for nonword errors subjects spent longer on target words throughout their encounter with them (i.e., across all eye movement measures). The effect of frequency was robustly found across all reading time measures (first fixation: b =17.72, t =5.17; single fixation duration: b =22.65, t =5.91; gaze duration: b =31.03, t =6.04; total time: b =35.43, t =4.56; go-past time: b =41.80, t =5.25) as was the effect of predictability (first fixation duration: b =12.22, t =4.08: single fixation duration: b =14.95, t =4.23; gaze duration: b =13.71, t =3.25; total time: b =20.78, t =3.85; go-past time: 22.71, t =4.33). Of more interest for our present purposes are the interactions between task and our manipulations of frequency and predictability. Here, the results are quite clear: frequency effects were reliably larger during proofreading than during reading across all measures (single fixation duration: b =13.12, t =2.07; gaze duration: b =29.91, t =3.13; total time: b =38.66, t =2.52, go-past time: 34.86, t =2.38) with the exception of first fixation duration (b =3.92, t <1) whereas the effect of predictability was not modulated by task in any fixation time measure (all ts<1.14). The interaction between task and the frequency effect in these data replicates Kaakinen and Hyönä’s result (in a different language: English), showing that the effect of frequency becomes larger when proofreading for spelling errors that produce nonwords (see goal 1, in Section 1.4). In addition, the lack of an interaction with task for the predictability items helps to tease apart the possible interpretations of Kaakinen and Hyönä’s finding (see goal 2, in Section 1.4). While the more cautious reading account predicted that there should be a similar interaction for the predictability materials, instead, these data support the task-sensitive word processing account, in which subjects process words in proofreading in a qualitatively different way that makes more use of frequency information but does not make more use of predictability. These data suggest that readers have a great deal of flexibility with respect to how they process words depending on their specific goal, making more or less use of each property of a word (e.g., its frequency or predictability from context) dependent on that feature’s informativeness for the task at hand. 2.2.2.2 Fixation probability measures Results of the logistic mixed-effects regression analyses on fixation probability measures are reported in Table 6 . As with the reading time measures, in Section 2.2.2.1, fixation probability measures showed a robust effect of task, with a higher probability of fixating the target (frequency items: z =2.49, p =.01; predictability items: z =3.77, p <.001), regressing into the target (frequency items: z =3.77, p <.001; predictability items: z =5.43, p <.001) and regressing out of the target for frequency items (z =4.47, p <.001) but not predictability items (all ps>.24). Frequency yielded a main effect on probability of fixating the target (z =4.24, p <.001) but not the probability of regressing out of the target (p >.22) or the probability of regressing into the target (p >.84). Predictability yielded a marginal effect on the probability of fixating the target (z =1.78, p =.08), a significant effect on the probability of regressing into the target (z =4.65, p <.001) and marginal effect on the probability of regressing out of the target (z =1.94, p =.05). The only significant interactions between task and our manipulations of frequency and predictability were on regressions into the target (frequency items: z =2.63, p <.01; predictability items: z =2.36, p <.001); all other interactions were not significant (all ps>.17). 2.2.2.3 Do frequency and predictability interact with task similarly? In addition to the analyses reported in Section 2.2.2.1, we tested whether the interaction in the frequency stimuli was significantly different from the null interaction in the predictability stimuli (i.e., the three-way interaction) in two key measures: gaze duration and total time. These measures have been taken to reflect the time needed for initial word identification (gaze duration) and to integrate the word into the sentence (total time). The results of these analyses revealed a significant three-way interaction for both gaze duration (b =11.95, t =2.01) and total time (b =19.93, t =2.27), confirming our analyses above in suggesting that the effect of predictability did not increase in proofreading while the effect of frequency did. Thus, our data do not show support for an account of proofreading in which subjects merely read more cautiously (and predictability effects would likewise increase) but rather support a qualitatively different type of task-sensitive word processing between reading for comprehension and proofreading. 3 Experiment 2 As discussed in Section 1.3.1, when proofreading for errors that produce real, wrong words, one must take into account the sentence context. Thus, one would expect that, when proofreading for wrong word errors, subjects may need to or want to take into account the predictability of a word more fully than they do when proofreading for nonword errors (as in Experiment 1 and Kaakinen & Hyönä, 2010). We might expect, then, that if subjects can adapt how they process words to the fine-grained demands of the task, then when proofreading for errors that produce actual words, subjects would show larger effects of predictability. Presumably, this would result from subjects’ need to spend more time determining whether a word that is unlikely in context is an error. To test whether subjects adapt how they process words based on the precise nature of the spelling errors included in the stimuli, we ran a second experiment, similar to Experiment 1 except that, during proofreading, subjects checked for spelling errors (letter transpositions) that produced real, wrong words (e.g., trail produced trial; “The runners trained for the marathon on the trial behind the high school.”). We analyzed the same reading measures as in Experiment 1 to determine whether (a) frequency effects are increased when checking for errors that constitute real, but inappropriate words and (b) to determine whether predictability effects increase when task demands make predictability information useful. Additionally, we analyzed global reading measures and local reading measures on target words in the filler stimuli (fillers during the reading task and errors during the proofreading task), comparing them between the two experiments, to assess the relative difficulty of proofreading for nonword errors and proofreading for wrong word errors. 3.1 Method The method of Experiment 2 was identical to the method for Experiment 1 with the following exceptions. 3.1.1 Subjects A different set of 48 subjects, with the same selection criteria as Experiment 1 participated in Experiment 2. 3.1.2 Materials The stimuli in Experiment 2 were identical to those in Experiment 1 except for the words that constituted errors in the proofreading task. Error stimuli were produced by selecting the transposition letter neighbor of the target word (from Johnson, 2009), which was inappropriate in the sentence context (e.g., trail produced trial; “The runners trained for the marathon on the trial behind the high school.”). Using these items from Johnson (2009) in both experiments meant that the base words from which the errors were formed were controlled across experiments for length, frequency, number of orthographic neighbors, number of syllables and fit into the sentence. Thus, the only difference between experiments was whether the transposition error happened to produce a real word. 3.1.3 Procedure The procedure was identical to Experiment 1 except that, in the proofreading block, subjects were instructed that they would be “looking for misspelled words that spell check cannot catch. That is, these misspellings happened to produce an actual word but not the word that the writer intended.” and there were 5 practice trials (three errors) preceding the proofreading block instead of 3. 3.2 Results and discussion 3.2.1 Question accuracy As in Experiment 1, subjects performed very well both on the comprehension questions (93% correct) and in the proofreading task (91% correct; Table 3). In addition to overall accuracy, we used responses in the proofreading task to calculate d′ scores (the difference between the z-transforms of the hit rate and the false alarm rate; a measure of error detection) for each subject and compared them between experiments using an independent samples t test. Proofreading accuracy was significantly higher in Experiment 1 (M =3.05, SE=.065) than in Experiment 2 (M =2.53, SE=.073; t(93)=5.37, p <.001), indicating that checking for real words that were inappropriate in the sentence context was more difficult than checking for spelling errors that produce nonwords. 3.2.2 Eye movement measures As with the analyses of Experiment 1 (when subjects were checking for nonwords) we analyzed reading measures on the target words in the frequency (e.g., metal/alloy) or predictability (weeds/roses) manipulation sentences when they were encountered in Experiment 2 (when subjects were checking for wrong words) to determine whether the type of error subjects anticipated changed the way they used different word properties (i.e., frequency and predictability; Tables 7–9 ). Experiment 1 revealed no evidence that the effect of the predictability of a word in the sentence differed in size between reading and proofreading (there was no interaction between predictability and task in any reading measure). Our interpretation of this result was that predictability information is not a more useful source of information when checking for nonwords as compared to when reading for comprehension. However, when the errors that must be detected are real, wrong words, the only way to detect an error is to determine whether the word makes sense in the sentence context, making predictability a more relevant word property for error detection. Thus, if our interpretation is correct that readers can qualitatively change the type of word processing they perform according to task demands, we may see the effect of predictability become larger in proofreading for wrong words (relative to reading). As with analyses of error-free items in Experiment 1, task (reading vs. proofreading) and independent variable (high vs. low) were entered as fixed effects in the LMMs. Separate LMMs were fit for frequency items and predictability items (except for the test of the three-way interaction, see Section 3.2.2.3). 3.2.2.1 Fixation time measures There was a significant main effect of task for all fixation time measures for sentences with a frequency manipulation (first fixation duration: b =24.14, t =5.49; single fixation duration: b =33.22, t =5.77; gaze duration: b =51.75, t =8.25; total time: b =155.25, t =5.72; go-past time: b =91.48, t =6.00) and for sentences with a predictability manipulation (first fixation duration: b =18.05, t =4.87; single fixation duration: b =19.73, t =4.95; gaze duration: b =44.79, t =6.99; total time: b =112.78, t =6.59; go-past time: 69.06, t =6.08), indicating that, when checking for spelling errors that produce wrong words subjects took more time, spending longer on the target words throughout their encounter with them (i.e., across all eye movement measures). Furthermore, the coefficients that estimate the effect size are notably larger in the second experiment, when subjects were checking for more subtle errors (letter transpositions that produced real words that were inappropriate in the context). The effect of frequency was robustly found across all reading time measures (first fixation: b =10.35, t =2.61; single fixation duration: b =14.73, t =2.95; gaze duration: b =25.56, t =3.66; total time: b =36.53, t =2.33; go-past time: b =47.18, t =3.80) as was the effect of predictability (first fixation duration: b =6.66, t =2.08: single fixation duration: b =11.04, t =3.12; gaze duration: b =20.95, t =4.14; total time: b =49.27, t =4.23; go-past time: 29.94, t =3.13). Of more interest for our present purposes are the interactions between task and our manipulations of frequency and predictability. Here, the results are quite clear: frequency effects were reliably larger during proofreading than reading across all measures (gaze duration: b =26.51, t =2.80; total time: b =55.08, t =2.21, go-past time: b =41.51, t =2.20) with the exception of first fixation duration (b =3.98, t =0.60) and single fixation duration (b =8.11, t =0.98) whereas predictability was not modulated by task in any reading measure (all ts<1.37) except for total time (b =57.60, t =2.72). These data suggest that, when checking for spelling errors that produce real but inappropriate words, proofreaders still perform a qualitatively different type of word processing, which specifically amplifies effects of word frequency. However, while proofreaders do not appear to change their use of predictability during initial word recognition (i.e., first pass reading), later word processing does show increased effects of how well the word fits into the context of the sentence (i.e., during total time). We return to the issue of why this effect only appears on a late measure in Section 4.2. 3.2.2.2 Fixation probability measures As with the reading time measures reported in Section 3.2.2.1, fixation probability measures showed a robust effect of task, with a higher probability of fixating the target (frequency items: z =4.92, p <.001; predictability items: z =5.41, p <.001), regressing into the target (frequency items: z =5.60, p <.001; predictability items: z =6.05, p <.001) and regressing out of the target (frequency items: z =3.64, p <.001; predictability items: z =4.15, p <.001) in the proofreading task than in the reading task. Frequency yielded a main effect on probability of fixating the target (z =5.77, p <.001) and probability of regressing out of the target (z =2.56, p <.01) but not probability of regressing into the target (p >.15). Predictability yielded a marginal effect on the probability of fixating the target (z =1.77, p =.08) and a significant effect on the probability of regressing into the target (z =5.35, p <.001) and regressing out of the target (z =3.71, p <.001). There was a significant interaction between task and frequency on the probability of fixating the target (z =2.14, p <.05) and a marginal interaction on the probability of regressing out of the target (z =1.77, p =.08). All other interactions were not significant (all ps>.17). Thus, it seems as if the interactions seen in total time in Experiment 2 were not due to an increased likelihood of making a regression into or out of the target word, but rather to the amount of time spent on the word during rereading. 3.2.2.3 Do frequency and predictability interact with task similarly? As in Experiment 1, we tested for the three-way interaction between target type (frequency vs. predictability), independent variable value (high vs. low) and task (reading vs. proofreading) to evaluate whether the interactions between independent variable and task were different between the frequency stimuli and the predictability stimuli. As in Section 2.2.2.3, we tested for the three-way interaction in two key measures: gaze duration (Fig. 1 ) and total time (Fig. 2 ). The results of these analyses revealed that neither the three-way interaction for gaze duration (b =5.59, t <1) nor total time (b =2.26, t <1) were significant, suggesting that, when proofreading for wrong word errors, subjects processed words in a way that magnified the effects of both word frequency and predictability in a similar way. However, when gaze duration was analyzed separately by stimulus set, the task by frequency interaction was significant but the task by predictability interaction was not, and the three-way interaction, while not significant, does suggest a trend in that direction. Thus, the data suggest that, in first pass reading, subjects certainly demonstrated increased sensitivity to frequency information (discussed above) and demonstrated only slight increased sensitivity to predictability information (certainly more than they demonstrated increased sensitivity to predictability information when proofreading in Experiment 1). However, the substantial interaction between task and predictability does not emerge until further inspection of the word (i.e., total time, see Section 4.2). 3.2.3 Comparisons between the two experiments The analyses reported in this section were performed on filler items from the reading task and items that contained errors in the proofreading task to assess the degree to which proofreading sentences that actually contain errors differs from reading error-free sentences for comprehension. When encountered in the reading block, sentences contained no errors and constituted the control sentences taken from Johnson (2009; i.e., “The runners trained for the marathon on the track behind the high school.”). When encountered in the proofreading block, sentences contained errors; In Experiment 1 errors constituted nonwords (i.e., “The runners trained for the marathon on the trcak behind the high school.”) and in Experiment 2 errors constituted wrong words (i.e., “The runners trained for the marathon on the trial behind the high school.”). To investigate how errors were detected, we compared both global reading measures (reading time on the entire sentence) and local reading measures on the target word (shown in italics, above, but not italicized in the experiments) between the correct trials (when encountered in the reading block) and error trials (when encountered in the proofreading block). Task (reading vs. proofreading) and experiment (Experiment 1 vs. Experiment 2) were entered as fixed effects. 3.2.3.1 Global reading measures We analyzed two global reading measures: total sentence reading time (TSRT; the total amount of time spent reading the sentence) and reading rate (words per minute: WPM), which index general reading efficiency (Rayner, 1998, 2009), to assess the general difficulty of the proofreading task, compared to the reading task, across the two experiments (see Table 10 ). More efficient reading is reflected by shorter total sentence reading time and faster reading rate (more words per minute). For the present analyses, data come from all stimuli, collapsed across target type. We entered task (reading vs. proofreading) and experiment (Experiment 1 vs. Experiment 2) as fixed effects in the LMMs. The global reading measures confirmed the results of the accuracy analyses: The proofreading task was more difficult than the reading task, and this difference was more pronounced in the second experiment. Both measures revealed significant effects of task (TSRT: b =814.8, t =7.99; WPM: b =−53.18, t =−9.74), with the proofreading task leading to less efficient (slower) reading (M TSRT =2986ms; M WPM =299 in Experiment 1 M TSRT =4320ms; M WPM =226 in Experiment 2) than the reading for comprehension task (M TSRT =2699ms; M WPM =327 in Experiment 1 M TSRT =2970ms; M WPM =304 in Experiment 2). Both measures also revealed a significant effect of experiment (TSRT: b =801.7, t =4.00; WPM: b =−47.84, t =−3.06), with less efficient reading in the second experiment than in the first experiment. More importantly, there was a significant interaction in both measures (TSRT: b =1063.1, t =5.23; WPM: b =−49.85, t =−4.62), with the effect of task (reading vs. proofreading) larger in the second experiment (when proofreading involved checking for wrong words) than in the first experiment (when proofreading involved checking for nonwords). 3.2.3.2 Local reading measures To assess how task demands change processing of the target words themselves (i.e., the only word that differed between tasks and between experiments in the proofreading task) we analyzed local reading measures (the same as mentioned above) on the filler trials; Tables 10–12 . All analyses revealed a significant effect of task (for all fixation time measures, all ts>12; for all fixation probability measures, all ps<.001) with longer reading times on and higher probabilities of fixating and regressing into or out of the target in the proofreading task than the reading task. There were significant differences between experiments in gaze duration and total time (both ts>2.09), as well as the probability of regressing out of and into the target (both ps<.001), but not for any of the other fixation time measures (all ts<1.77) or the probability of fixating the target (p =.32). Most important for our purposes were tests for interactions between task and experiment. Analyses of fixation time measures revealed significant but qualitatively different interactions between task and experiment for early and late reading measures. There were significant interactions for early reading measures (first fixation duration: b =−19.24, t =2.25; single fixation duration: b =−31.18, t =2.78; gaze duration: b =−45.41, t =3.18) with a larger increase in reading time in the proofreading block when checking for nonword errors (Experiment 1) than when checking for wrong word errors (Experiment 2; see Fig. 1). These data suggest that, upon initial inspection of the words, errors were detected (and produced longer reading times) more easily when they resulted in nonwords than when they resulted in wrong words. The pattern of results changed, though, in later measures. Here, reading time on the target increased more in the proofreading block when checking for wrong words (Experiment 2) than when checking for nonwords (Experiment 1) for total time on the target (b =191.27, t =3.88; see Fig. 2) but not significantly in go-past time (t <.32). There was no significant interaction between task and experiment on the probability of fixating or regressing into the target (both ps>.14) but there was a significant interaction on the probability of regressing out of the target (z =2.92, p <.001) with a small increase in regressions out of the target in Experiment 1 (.07 in reading compared to .08 in proofreading) and a large effect in Experiment 2 (.09 in reading compared to .18 in proofreading). These data confirm that the proofreading task in Experiment 2 (checking for real, but inappropriate words for the context) was more difficult than the proofreading task in Experiment 1 (checking for nonwords). Early reading time measures increased more in Experiment 1 than Experiment 2, suggesting that these errors were easier to detect upon initial inspection. However, in later measures, reading time increased more in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1, suggesting these errors often required a subsequent inspection to detect. 4 General discussion Let us now consider these data in light of the theoretical framework laid out in the Introduction. Based on consideration of five component processes central to normal reading—wordhood assessment, form validation, content access, integration, and word-context validation—and how different types of proofreading are likely to emphasize or de-emphasize each of these component processes, this framework made three basic predictions regarding the outcome of our two experiments, each of which was confirmed. Additionally, several key patterns in our data were not strongly predicted by the framework but can be better understood within it. We proceed to describe these cases below, and then conclude this section with a brief discussion of the differences in overall difficulty of the two proofreading tasks. 4.1 Basic predictions of the framework Our framework made three basic predictions, each confirmed in our data. First, overall speed should be slower in proofreading than in normal reading, provided that errors are reasonably difficult to spot and that readers proofread accurately. The errors we introduced into our stimuli all involved single word-internal letter swaps expected a priori to be difficult to identify, and our readers achieved very high accuracy in proofreading—higher in Experiment 1 (95%) than in Experiment 2 (91%). Consistent with our framework’s predictions under these circumstances, overall reading speed (e.g., TSRT – total sentence reading time) was slower during proofreading than during normal reading in both experiments. (Note, however, that the two types of proofreading interacted in slightly different ways with word frequency; see Section 4.2 for further discussion.) However, we must also note that even tasks that should be less onerous than reading (e.g., x-string scanning) can lead to longer reading times (Rayner & Fischer, 1996). Second, our framework predicted that effects of proofreading for nonwords should not show up exclusively in late measures, since proofreading for nonwords should emphasize word identification processes, which must occur upon first encountering a word. Consistent with this prediction, in Experiment 1 we found effects of task on early measures including fixation probability, first fixation duration, single fixation duration, and gaze duration; and interactions of task with word frequency on single-fixation duration and gaze duration. Third, our framework predicted that predictability effects should be magnified more in proofreading for wrong words than in proofreading for nonwords, since proofreading for wrong words emphasizes processes that intrinsically implicate the degree of fit between a word and the rest of the sentence, (e.g., word-context validation and integration), but proofreading for nonwords does not. Indeed, whereas when proofreading for nonwords (Experiment 1) the task (reading vs. proofreading) never interacted with predictability, when proofreading for wrong words (Experiment 2) task and predictability interacted in regressions into and total time on the target word. With respect to interpretation of Kaakinen and Hyönä’s previous results on proofreading, our new results overall favor our framework’s task-sensitive word processing account, in which component sub-processes of reading are differentially modulated by change of task, over the more cautious reader account, in which proofreading simply involves processing words to a higher degree of confidence. In the more cautious reading account, sensitivity to each word property that we manipulated (frequency and predictability) should be affected similarly by both types of proofreading—frequency and predictability effects would have been magnified across the board. Instead, we see different effects on predictability in proofreading for nonwords vs. proofreading for wrong words, consistent with our framework. 4.2 Further results interpretable within the framework The other major results in our data, though not directly predicted by our framework, can be readily understood within it. First, Experiment 1 affirms Kaakinen and Hyönä’s (2010) original result that frequency effects are larger in proofreading for nonwords, showing that the pattern they found in Finnish also holds in English. Experiment 2 extended this result to the case of proofreading for spelling errors that produce real words. These results were supported by interactions between frequency effects and task (in both early and late reading measures) for error-free trials. Importantly, effects of word frequency were modulated differently in the two proofreading tasks. In Experiment 1 (proofreading for nonwords), task did not affect reading speed on high frequency words, but did slow reading of low frequency words. In Experiment 2, on the other hand, proofreading slowed reading on all words (including high frequency words). To investigate this, we performed analyses separately on high frequency words and low frequency words, testing for the effects of task (reading vs. proofreading), experiment, and the interaction between them (with linear mixed effects models with the maximal random effects structure) and follow-up paired comparisons between reading times on either high frequency words or low frequency words (analyzed separately) as a function of task. For gaze duration, the main effect of task among only high frequency words was not significant in Experiment 1 (t =0.13) but was significant in Experiment 2 (t =5.61), confirming that high frequency words were unaffected by proofreading for nonwords (the same pattern of data was observed for other reading time measures). For gaze duration for low frequency words, the main effect of task was significant in both Experiment 1 (t =3.72) and Experiment 2 (t =7.89), confirming that they were always affected by task, regardless of what type of proofreading was being performed (the same pattern of data was observed for all other reading time measures except the effect of task was not significant on first fixation duration for Experiment 1 or go-past time in Experiment 2). Although this difference is not directly predicted within our framework, it is compatible with it: the result implies that wordhood assessment, the sole frequency-sensitive process emphasized in proofreading for nonwords, is of only minimal difficulty for high frequency words but that content access, the sole frequency-sensitive process emphasized in proofreading for wrong words, is of non-minimal difficulty even for high frequency words. Third is the question of why predictability effects were unchanged in proofreading for nonwords, rather than being magnified (to a lesser degree than in proofreading for wrong words) or reduced. Any of these results would have been compatible with our framework; recalling Table 1 and Section 1.4, predictability may be implicated in wordhood assessment and/or content access, and is certainly implicated in integration and word-context validation. Thus, our result implies either that none of content access, integration, or word-context validation is actually diminished during nonword proofreading, or that predictability is involved in wordhood assessment. Although our data do not distinguish between these two possibilities, the latter seems highly plausible, especially considering previous results that visual sentence context can strongly modulate explicit visual lexical decision times (Wright & Garrett, 1984). We also consider it unlikely that sentence-level integration is completely shut off even during proofreading for nonwords; given that one basic consequence of linguistic context in reading is that it allows for reading to proceed more quickly (Bicknell & Levy, 2012; Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Morton, 1964; Rayner & Well, 1996), it makes sense that subjects would continue to use linguistic context during word processing (and thus show predictability effects) in order to proofread more quickly. Interestingly, one of the differences between our (and Kaakinen & Hyönä’s, 2010) proofreading paradigm and the other proofreading studies described in Section 1.3.2 is that the other experiments often emphasized speed as opposed to accuracy (to avoid ceiling effects since their dependent measure was percent detection). It would be worth investigating in future studies whether and how the effects we have found here would change if speed were emphasized as opposed to accuracy. We must also address the fact that predictability effects were modulated only for late measures, not for early measures, in Experiment 2. Once again, this result is not directly predicted by our framework, but is compatible with it. One possibility is that subjects in our study may have been hesitant to flag an unpredictable word as an error until they see the context words to the right (or reread context to the left). Because subjects received feedback on every trial (a subjectively annoying 3s timeout with the word “INCORRECT!” displayed on the screen), we assume they were highly motivated to avoid responding incorrectly. This happened not only after misses (i.e., failing to respond that there was an error when there was one) but also after false alarms (i.e., responding that there was an error when there was not). Thus, subjects may have been reluctant to prematurely (i.e., in first-pass reading) respond without seeing whether words after the target would make the word fit into context. For example, the error “The marathon runners trained on the trial…” could be salvaged with a continuation such as “… course behind the high school.” Obviously, subjects would not know this without reading the rest of the sentence and may, for all sentences, continue reading to become more confident whether the sentence contained an error or not. Once subjects know both the left and right context of the word, they then evaluate the word’s fit into the sentence context, and it is this latter process that produces large effects of word predictability in total time. Finally, we note that several aspects of our data confirm that proofreading is more difficult when spelling errors produce wrong words (e.g., trial for trail) compared to when they produce nonwords (e.g., trcak for track). First, d′ scores for proofreading accuracy when checking for wrong words (Experiment 2) were lower than d′ scores when checking for nonwords (Experiment 1; see Table 1). Furthermore, this difference was driven by poorer performance correctly identifying errors (81% in Experiment 2 compared to 89% in Experiment 1) rather than performance correctly identifying error-free sentences (98% vs. 97%). Second, reading efficiency (total sentence reading time and reading rate) was poorer when proofreading for wrong words than when proofreading for nonwords. Our framework made no direct predictions regarding this result, but it follows naturally from consideration of what information sources are required to detect each type of error. As discussed in Section 1.3.1, nonword spelling errors may be more easily detectable based on surface features (e.g., trcak violates rules of English orthography while trial does not). Identifying a nonword error requires only successful wordhood assessment—which can be done without regard for context but which context may nevertheless be helpful for—while identifying a wrong word error requires successful word-context validation. Thus, more information sources support nonword identification than support wrong word identification. In this vein, the question naturally arises to what extent readers were using orthographic or phonological well-formedness to identify nonwords, as opposed to a full check against the lexicon or against context. To investigate this question, we coded each error item in Experiment 1 as being either pronounceable or unpronounceable in English. Even though approximately half of the words were pronounceable and half were not, this distinction did not affect detection accuracy (88% vs. 89%; z <1, p >.94). These data suggest that subjects were primarily assessing wordhood through a full check against the lexicon or against context, rather than purely checking surface features such as pronounceability. As mentioned above, though, the errors in Experiment 1 were easier to detect than those in Experiment 2, suggesting that the need to integrate the word with the sentence context in order to identify whether it is an error was likely what made the proofreading task in Experiment 2 more difficult. 5 Conclusion The results of our study, combined with the experiments discussed in the introduction (Section 1), suggest that word and sentence processing during reading is highly adaptive and responsive to task demands. That is, our subjects’ proofreading performance involved not just a more cautious version of normal reading, but rather a qualitative readjustment of different component sub-processes of overall reading so as to efficiently achieve high accuracy in identifying errors. We saw that the size of the frequency effect increased when proofreading for any type of spelling error, reflecting the fact that word frequency is useful for detecting violations of word status (i.e., nonwords do not have a detectable word frequency), which might be a first step in checking for spelling errors. Likewise, when the relationship between words was crucial to identify spelling errors (in Experiment 2), we saw that the magnitude of the predictability effect increased, as well. Relative to the previous literature, our data show an especially clear demonstration of the flexibility and precise control subjects have over the component processes involved in reading, since we used tasks with the same subjects, stimuli, and response measures. Our findings imply that, in the future, researchers should anticipate the way in which the instructions they give to subjects and the types of questions they ask of them might change the way they approach the task of reading and subsequently the way in which they process words and sentences. Our interpretation that subjects can have such fine-grained control over how they perform linguistic processing in response to subtle differences in task demands is quite consistent with other extant data. As another example from the reading domain, Radach, Huestegge, and Reilly (2008) presented data suggesting that frequency effects are larger when readers expect comprehension questions than when they expect word verification questions (although the interaction was not significant). Wotschack and Kliegl (2013) also reported modulation of both frequency and predictability effects in response to differential question difficulty. Taken together, these results and ours fit naturally with claims that readers optimize how they read for their particular goals (Bicknell & Levy, 2010; Lewis, Shvartsman, & Singh, 2013) and that reading behavior can be well described as adaptive. The general framework we introduced for understanding task-specific modulations in different component processing of reading, which predicted several of the key findings of our experiments and shed light on several more, may prove to be of further use in understanding modulations of reading behavior with other tasks, such as different types of proofreading (e.g., word-position errors) and scanning for keywords. More generally, our findings broaden the range of examples of the adaptability of cognition, and point to the remarkable potential of the human mind to shape the details of even very highly practiced cognitive processing to the precise demands of the task and the agent’s particular goals.
