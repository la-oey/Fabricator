Abstract Visual search, a dominant paradigm within attention research, requires observers to rapidly identify targets hidden
D among distractors. Major models of search presume that working memory (WM) provides the on-line work space for
evaluating potential targets. According to this hypothesis, individuals with higher WM capacity should search more efficiently, because they should be able to apprehend a larger number of search elements at a time. Nevertheless, no
E compelling evidence of such a correlation has emerged, and this null result challenges a growing consensus that there is
strong overlap between the neural processes that limit internal storage and those that limit external selection. Here, we provide multiple demonstrations of robust correlations between WM capacity and search efficiency, and we document
T a key boundary condition for observing this link. Finally, examination of a neural measure of visual selection capacity
(the N2pc) demonstrates that visual search and WM storage are constrained by a common discrete resource.

R Working memory (WM) is typically defined as an on-line
work space where information can be efficiently accessed
T and updated (Baddeley, 1986; Smith & Jonides, 1999).
Thus, it is a natural hypothesis that WM would be required for visual search, an attention-demanding task that
E requires the rapid apprehension of multi-element displays
to find a target. Indeed, virtually every major model of
R visual search has postulated a role for WM (e.g., Bundesen,

individuals identify targets more quickly when it is necessary to overcome distraction from salient irrelevant items (Poole & Kane, 2009; Sobel, Gerrie, Poole, & Kane, 2007). These studies support previous suggestions that WM capacity is critical for resisting distraction (e.g., Engle, 2002; Vogel & Awh, 2008), but because they measured search performance using absolute reaction time (RT)--a measure that is not sensitive to search efficiency--they do

T Experiments 1a, 1b, and 1c C Method
Sixty-five undergraduates at the University of Oregon (23, 25, and 17 in Experiments 1a, 1b, and 1c, respectively)
A completed the experiments for course credit or monetary
compensation. All participants gave informed consent according to procedures approved by the University of
R Oregon institutional review board. Stimuli were generated in MATLAB using the
T Psychophysics Toolbox extension (Brainard, 1997; Pelli,
1997) and were presented on a 17-in. flat CRT computer screen (120-Hz refresh rate). The viewing distance was
E approximately 77 cm. Participants first performed a WM R task and then a visual search task.

Fig. 1. Illustration of the tasks and search displays in Experiment 1. In the working memory task (a), participants were instructed to maintain fixation and to remember the orientation of all six objects presented in the display. After a short delay, six probe rings were presented, and participants clicked on the thicker ring to report the position of the gap in the sample item that had appeared in that position. In the visual search task (b), participants maintained fixation and were instructed to identify the direction (right or left) of the target letter L. Set sizes ranged from 1 to 8. Participants used the left or right arrow key to indicate whether the vertical segment of the L was on the left or right, respectively. Target-distractor similarity and distractor variability were manipulated (c). In Experiment 1a and one condition of Experiment 1c, both target-distractor similarity and distractor variability were high (Example 1). In Experiment 1b, target-distractor similarity was lower than in Experiment 1a (the relative position of the vertical segment was always different in targets than in distractors), and distractor variability was low (Example 2). Finally, in Experiment 1c, the vertical segment of the L was shifted inward, so that target-distractor similarity was even higher than in Experiment 1a, but grouping was still encouraged by

R upright T shapes. Target-distractor similarity was lower
than in Experiment 1a because although all stimuli contained right angles, the relative position of the vertical
T segment was always different in targets than in distrac-
tors. In this experiment, uniform distractors could be grouped and rejected as groups (Duncan & Humphreys,
E 1989). One condition of Experiment 1c was the same as in
R Experiment 1a. In the other condition, uniform distrac-

was incorrect or RT was 3 standard deviations (or more) above or below the mean. Average RT was calculated for each set size, and search efficiency was operationalized as the slope of the RT-by-set-size function.
Results and discussion
Experiment 1a: WM capacity correlates with search efficiency when individuation is required.There was a significant effect of set size on RT in this experiment (Fig. 2a), F(7, 16) = 67.08, p < .001. Set size had no effect on accuracy, F(7, 16) = 1.55, p = .22--evidence against a significant speed-accuracy trade-off. The slope of the RT-by-set-size function (25.8 ms/item) indicated relatively inefficient search (Wolfe, 1998), and split-half reliability was strong (.87). The critical result was a robust correlation between WM capacity and search efficiency (Fig. 2b), R2 = .63, p < .0001, such that slopes were shallower for higher-capacity observers. By contrast, WM capacity did not predict the intercept of the RT-by-setsize function, R2 = .013, p > .60, which suggests that highcapacity subjects had an advantage in search efficiency per se rather than a more general advantage in processing speed or better maintenance of the task set.

and black, respectively.

Experiment 1c: difficult search alone does not reveal the link between WM capacity and search efficiency. An alternative interpretation of the null result from Experiment 1b is that the correlation was masked because the search task was easier (and the range of slopes was reduced). To test this possibility, we made the target alternatives in the uniform-distractor condition of Experiment 1c harder to discriminate and more similar to the distractors (Fig. 1c, third example). Search slopes increased markedly in this condition, perhaps because

observers needed more time to reject each distractor. Nevertheless, the uniform distractors still facilitated grouping. If lower search slopes per se masked the correlation in Experiment 1b, then this more challenging search task might reveal a link between WM capacity and search efficiency. By contrast, if distractor grouping was responsible for masking the correlation, then we would not find any correlation in this condition either. Experiment 1c also included separate blocks of a condition that replicated Experiment 1a (variable-distractor condition).

R ever, requires search displays that minimize distractor

tion to the task at hand should have given them an advantage in all search tasks, not just the ones that minimized distractor grouping. Our conclusion is that search efficiency per se is better among subjects with higher WM capacity.
Experiment 2
The hypothesis that WM capacity limits the number of search items that can be selected simultaneously presumes that visual search is indeed constrained by an item limit. Experiment 2 tested this assumption by measuring the amplitude of the N2pc waveform, a phasic negative deflection in event-related potential (ERP) amplitude over posterior electrodes contralateral to visually selected items (Luck, Girelli, McDermott, & Ford, 1997; Luck & Hillyard, 1994). Recent work has shown that N2pc amplitude provides a sensitive index of the number of items selected (Anderson et al., 2011, in press; Drew & Vogel, 2008; Pagano & Mazza, 2012). Thus, if there is a discrete limit in the number of items an observer can select during search, then N2pc amplitude should reach a plateau when the number of items to be searched exceeds the observer's selection capacity. In turn, if the N2pc provides a valid measure of visual selection capacity, then it should predict individual differences in search efficiency. We tested these predictions

dict visual search efficiency. To test whether this was the case, we fit a bilinear model to the data from each observer (average R2 = .62); this fit was superior to that provided by an exponential function (predicted by models that eschew item limits for visual selection). Critically, the inflection point of the bilinear function was strongly correlated with search efficiency (Fig. 3e; R2 = .31, p < .01), a result showing that the N2pc-by-set-size function is sensitive to individual selection capacity. Thus, the plateau in N2pc amplitude across set sizes constitutes evidence for a relatively low item limit constraining visual selection, and the correlation with search efficiency shows that this item limit determines the efficiency of visual search. Finally, we also found a strong correlation between the inflection point of the N2pcby-set-size function in the search task and WM capacity (Fig. 3f; R2 = .30, p < .01), which suggests that a common item limit constrains visual search and storage in WM.

Results from Experiment 2: (a) reaction time (RT) as a function of set size, (b) individual participants' search slopes (with best-fitting regression line) as a function of working memory (WM) capacity, (c) grand-averaged difference waves (contralateral amplitude - ipsilateral amplitude) from the OL and OR electrodes at each set size ("SS"), (d) N2pc amplitude as a function of set size (with a fitted bilinear function), (e) individual participants' search slopes (with best-fitting regression line) as a function of the inflection point of the N2pc-by-set-size function, and (f) WM capacity (with best-fitting regression line) as a function of the inflection point of the N2pc-byset-size function. In (a) and (d), error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. In (c), the gray shading indicates the temporal window used to measure N2pc amplitudes.

WM during the lateralized search task, but they leave uncertain the specific role that WM played. For example, rather than indicating the selection of currently searched items, the CDA activity observed by Emrich et al. could have been elicited by the storage of previously searched locations (McCarley, Wang, Kramer, Irwin, & Peterson, 2003; Peterson, Kramer, Wang, Irwin, & McCarley, 2001; but see Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998) or the broader act of attending the relevant and suppressing the irrelevant side of space. Thus, the central value of the present work is to elucidate the way in which WM is integral to visual search. These two processes may call upon a common discrete resource that limits the number of items that can be selected, during either internal storage or external selection.
To conclude, our findings corroborate the long-standing but poorly supported assumption that visual WM provides the on-line work space for the analysis of potential targets during visual search (Bundesen, 1990; Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Duncan & Humphreys, 1989; Fisher, 1982; Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Wolfe, 2005). This finding dovetails with a growing body of research indicating that there are pervasive links between storage in on-line memory systems and the top-down selection of relevant aspects of the environment (Awh & Jonides, 2001; Chun, 2011; Cowan, 2001; Engle, 2002; Gazzaley & Nobre, 2011; Vogel & Awh, 2008). Our working hypothesis is that mul-
